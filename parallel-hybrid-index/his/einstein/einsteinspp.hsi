<b>Albert Einstein</b> ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]]. He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize]] for his account of the [[photoelectric effect]]; however, the announcement of his award was not made until a year later, in 1922.  His theoretical work suggested the possibility of creating an [[atomic bomb]].
Einstein was born [[March 14]]€ [[1879]] at Ulm in Württemberg, [[Germany]].  He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in Italy, and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. At age 17 he renounced his German citizenship and later, in 1901, was accepted as a Swiss citizen.  He obtained his doctorate in [[1905]].  That same year, he wrote four articles that lay the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this miracle year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of atoms. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whther atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect. Einstein's theory of light quanta received almost no support from other physicists for nearly 20 years. It contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior. Even after experiments demonstrated that Einstein's equations for the photoe€ric effect were splendidly accurate, his explanation was not accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, the idea of light quanta was impossible.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of €lativity]], a detailed analysis of the concepts of time, distance, mass and energy which omits the force of gravity.  Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the speed of light is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences since the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected. The theory came to be called "special th€relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (E) equals mass (m) times the square of the speed of light (c) squared. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable at understanding how the [[Big Bang]] (which was a pure burst of energy) could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter. More immediately, however, the equation set people to dreaming of explosive weaponry, although atomic bombs only became a practical possibility after nuclear physics had developed considerably beyond the few vague speculations of 1905. (Remember that before that year, even the existence of atoms was controversial.)
In November 1915 Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers €equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's la€of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]], is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of li€ht quanta showed the revolutionary break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together. However, in the mid-1920's, as the original quantum th€ory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more (in his terminology) "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a letter to [[Max Born]] dated  December 12, 1926. It was not a rejection of statistical theory. He had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miracle year of 1905 he even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In 1914, just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins made him unpopular with German nationalists. After he became world famous (on November 7, 1919, when the [[London Times]] reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious. In 1933, after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power, he settled in the United States and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in 1940. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died [[April 18]], [[1955]] in [[Prin€ Jersey]].
Einstein considered himself a socialist.
In an article in 1949, he described the "predatory phase of human development", exemplified by an anarchistic capitalist society, as a source of evil to be overcome.
He disapproved of the totalitarian socialist regimes in the Soviet Union and elsewhere; nowadays, his position would probably be characterized as social democratic.
He first favored construction of the atomic bomb in order to defeat Hitler, but after the war he lobbied for nuclear disarmament and a world government.
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but turned the offer down.
His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans.
He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Copenhagen, play|Copenhagen]], [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.

The theory solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not travel through a medium (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].

The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear wea€on|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[fission]] or [[fusion]].
In November [€y.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).
In [[191€to power, he was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[Unit€ world."

Around 1884, Einstein obtains his first compass. Einstein begins a course of studies of self-education and absorbs as much science as possible.  He begins to learn mathematics and calculus around [[1891]].
In [[1894]], the Einsteins move to Pavia, Italy (near Milan) from Munich. Albert Einstein stays in Munich to finish school. He completes a term by hisself and then moves to Pavia also. In [[1895]], Einstein takes an exam to the Swiss Polytechnic and fails the arts portion of the test. He is sent by his family to Aarau, [[Switzerland]] to finish secondary school. In [[1896]], Einstein graduates from high school.
He subsequently enrolls at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, the Federal Swiss Polytechnic University, in Zurich. Also in [[1896]]€ Einstein renounces his German citizenship. He is a stateless individual. In [[1898]], Albert meets Mileva Maric, a Hungarian classmate at the Ei€chschule, and falls in love withy her.

====Princeton====
His work at Princeton have as a consequence the unification of the [[laws of physics]]. The quest for the unification of four fundamental forces is undertaken Einstein and he spends his last 20 years trying to acomplish this. Einstein attempts to construct a model, under the appropriate conditions, which describes a unified single force.
====Generalized Theory====
Einstein begins to form a Generalized Theory of Gravitation with the universal law of gravitation and the electromagnetic force in his first attempt to demonstrate the unification and simplification of the fundamental forces. In the [[1950s]], he describes his work in a Scientific American article.  Einstein is guided by the belief of a single statistical measure of variance for the entire set of physical laws and he investigates the smiliar properties of the electromagnetic and gravity forces, as they are infinite and obey the inverse square law.
Einstein's Generalized theory of gravitation is a universal mathematical approach to field theory. He investigates reducing the different phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or evident. Einstein tries to unify grav€magnetism in a way that also lead to a new subt€mechanics.
Einstein assumes a structure of a four-dimensional space-time continuum expressed in axioms represented by five component vectors. Particle appear in his research as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high. Einstein treats subatomic particles in this research as objects embedded in the unified field, influencing it and existing as an essential constituent of the eunified field but not of it. Einstein also investigates a natural generalization of symmetrical tensor fields, treating the combination of two parts of the field being a natural procedure of the the total field and not the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts separately. He researches a way to delineate the equations to be derived from a variational principle.
Einstein in increasin€ isolated in his research over a Generaliz€avitation and ultima€uccessful in his attempts at constru€hanics]].
====Final years====
In [[1952]], the Israeli government proposes to Einstein that he take the post of second president. He declines the offer.
He dies in 1955, leaving the Generalize€avitation unsolved. He died €Princeton. Einstein is cremated the day he dies at [[Trenton]], [[New Jersey]] on [[April 18]], [[1955]]. His ashes were distributed at an undisclosed location.

His attempt was in a way doomed to failure because the stron and weak nuclear forces were not understood independently until around 1970, 15 years after Eins€n's death. Einstein's goal survives in the current drive for unification of the forces, embodied most notably by [[string theory]].

The name "Einstein" evokes images of genius, but Albert Einstein was, in fact, a plagiarist, who copied the theories of Lorentz, Poincare, Gerber, and Hilbert. Christopher Jon Bjerknes has authored a scholarly documentation of Albert Einstein's plagiarism titled <i><b>Albert Einstein: The Incorrigible Plagiarist</b></i> which details Einstein's€lagiarism from his contemporaries, in addition to providing formal logical argument demonstrating that Einstein could not have drawn the conclusions he claimed to have drawn without prior knowlege of the works he copied, but did not cite. Numerous quotations from Einstein's contemporaries are also included, supporting the notion that Einstein's€lagiarism had indeed been noticed.

Einstein was a believer in [[Zionism]] and claimed that maintenance of the roots of [[Zionism]], the "Jewish spiritual tradition," was the only justification for the continued existence of the global jewish community. Einstein also claimed that antisemitism in Germany in his experience was partly a result of the disproportionate influence of jewish intellectuals in academic German society. He further claimed at this time that the establishment of a jewish state was was necessary, not to provide a homeland for jews, since it would only ever be possible for an extreme minority of jews in the world to live in Israel, but to give legitimacy to the non-assimilated jews dwelling in the nations of others.
The above claims were made in 1929, one year after the termination of Einstein's appointment as a university governor, and published by the [[Hebrew Uni€erusalem]] in 1930 in a volume titled <b><i>About Zionism:  Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein</i></b>. In 1933, Einstein was again offered a position at the university, and he refused it. He bequeathed h€rusalem]].

However, in [[January]] [[1946]] Einstein stated: "The State idea is not according to my heart. I cannot understand why it is needed. It is connected with narrow-mindedness and economic obstacles. I believe that it is bad. I have always been against it. He went further to deride the concept of a Jewish commonwealth as an "imitation of Europe, the end of which was brought about by nationalism."
In his [[1950]] book, ''Out of My Later Years'', he said: "I should much rather see a reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together than the creation of a Jewish state. Apart from practical considerations, my awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain."

Einstein claimed he was a zionist, but stated explicitly that he was purely a religionist zionist, feeling that zionism and judaic tradition were consistent and that he shared beliefs of what he termed "<i>fellow religionists</i>". He further explicitly stated in 1929 that he was not a <i>racial</i> zionist and did not share the belief that judaism necessitated the view of Israelis as the "<i>chosen [people]</i>".

The theor€uation is associated with [[Nuclear €weapons]] and is used to explain how they produce su€ energy.  The exact connection between the equation and nuclear weapons is less well known, however.  By measuring the mass of atomic nuclei and dividing them by their atomic number, both of which are easily measured, one can calculate the binding energy which is trapped in different atomic nuclei.  This allows one to figure out which nuclear reactions will release energy and how much energy they will release.  A simple calculation using the mass of the uranium nuclei and the masses of the products of [[nuc€fission]] reveals that large amounts of energy are released upon fission, and this led physicists in the 1930's to begin to consider the possibility of a nuclear weapon.

==Manuscrito inédito de Einstein Demuestra que creía en un Dios personal 06-03-2003 18:59
*Roma, 24 -02-2003 (La Razón/ICPress).- Einstein ha sido considerado, a nivel mundial, según estadísticas publicadas por los medios de comunicación social, la persona más importante del siglo XX. El físico quiso dejar muy clara su posición respecto a su fe en Dios. Manifestó: "a generalizada opinión, según la cual yo sería un ateo, se funda en un gran error".
* Como científico Albert Einstein fue un genio. Físico y matemático de origen alemán, Premio Nobel de Física por su descubrimiento de la ley del efecto fotoeléctrico, demostró matemáticamente que a las tres dimensiones del espacio físico, había que añadir una cuarta dimensión: el concepto tiempo. Ayudó a su encumbramiento su teoría general de la relatividad, así como otras investigaciones sobre la teoría cinética de los gases.
* Einstein ha sido c€siglo XX. Un dominico, Jordán Gallego, ha hecho público el testimonio de puño y letra del sabio que aclara la fe en Dios de Albert Einstein.
*El físico €e en Dios.
Manifestó: «La generaliza€gran error. Quien lo deduce de mis teorías científicas, no las ha comprendido. No sólo me ha interpretado mal sino que me hace un mal servicio si él divulga informaciones erróneas a propósito de mi actitud para con la religión. Yo creo en un Dios personal y puedo decir, con plena conciencia, que: en mi vida, jamás me he suscrito a una concepción atea». Albert Einstein. (Deutsches Pfarrblatt, Bundes-Blatt der Deutschen Pfarrvereine,1959, 11).

== Commercial usage: Albert Einstein(TM) ==
"Albert Einstein" is a [[registered trademark]] of [[The Roger Richman Agency, Inc.]] [http://www.hollywoodlegends.com], that controls the (commercial) usage of the name. Advertisements and merchandise including the name, likeness and image of Albert Einstein must be licensed by this agency. In this specific case the agency acts as a representative of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which Einstein himself has supported actively, and this institution will benefit from all license fees. Furthermore, the agency may entirely prevent usage of Albert Einstein(TM) in a way that does not conform to the public image of the trademark. The agency's website dedicated to Albert Einstein(TM) [http://ww€-einstein.net] states that "When written in copy on all materialy, the name 'Albert Einstein(TM)' must always bear a (TM) symbol." (see [http://www€nstein.net/styleguide-readonly/brand.html]).
Though the general purpose of ''Roger Richman Agency'' -- at least in the case of Einstein -- is not a purely commercial one, there is some controversy about the licensing of popular names. The agency "owns" numerous other well-recognized names, such as "[[Sigmund Freud]]" and "[[Steve McQueen]]", and apparently uses the associated rights not exclusively for the protection of the dignity of these symbols. Indeed, the agency's official website advertises its service claiming that "celebrated personalities deliver instant recognition, recall and credibility to your advertising campaign and/or promotional program." On the other hand, various licensed advertisements feature rather a [[caricature]] of the scientist. These could be considered as a misuse of Einstein's popularity, since they lead to a further distortion of Einstein's public image instead of displaying him as "one of the most renowned scientists and humanitarians of all time" as advertised on the agency's webpages.

There were, however, many who were still unconvinced in the scientific community. Their reason varied, ranging from those who disagreed with Einstein's interpretations of the experiments to those who simply thought that life without an absolute frame of reference was intolerable. In Einstein's view, many of them simply could not understand the mathematics involved. Einstein's public fame which followed the 1919 eclipse created resentment among this faction, some of which would last well into the 1930s.

====Institute €nced Study====
His work at the Institute for Advanced Study focused o€ his work. Though he is now most famous for his work on Relativity, it was for his earlier work on the [[phot€ effect]] that he was given the Prize: in 1921 his work on€Relativity was still to contentious to award a Nobel Prize, so the Nobel committee decided that it his earlier, less-contested theory would be a better political move.

==Einstein's Plagiarism==
Numerous sources have directly or indirectly accused Albert Einstein of plagiarism. These charges range from Einstein's appropriation of the special th€relativity through unattributed use of the Lorentz Transformation and Henri Poincare's "principle of relativity" in Einstein's paper 1905 ''Zur Elektr€bewegter Koerper'', to broader accusations of a career long pattern of plagiarism. The latter point of view is taken by Christophe€ Bjerknes in his books ''Albert E€agiarist'' [http://home.comcast.net/~xtxinc/AEIPBook.htm] and ''Anticipations of Einstein in the General Th€Relativity''.[http://ho€~xtxinc/AEGRBook.htm] Bjerknes points out that the special th€elativity first appeared in the works of Woldemar Voigt, George Franc€Fitzgerald, Joseph Larmor, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Henri Poincare.
Einstein was often accused of plagiarism. He did not answer his critics in a responsible fashion and so missed the opp€tunity to justify his behavior. Other books which provide insights into Einstein's unnamed sources include: E. Whittaker, ''A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity''; A. A. Logunov, ''The Theory of Gravity'' and ''On the Articles by Henri Poincaré ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE ELECTRON''; J. P. Auffray, ''Einstein et Poincare''; J. Leveugle ''La Relativite, Poincare et Einstein, Planck, Hilbert: Histoire veridique de la Theorie de la Relativite''; J. Hladik, ''Comment le jeune et ambitieux Einstein s'est approprie la Relativite restreinte de Poincare''; J. Mehra, ''Einstein, Hilbert, and the Theory of €ravitation''.
===Jules Henri Poincare===
Anatoly Alexeivich Logunov has proven the priority and the superiority of Poincare's formulation of the specia€elativity over Einstein's later and less sophisticated work. Poincare pioneered the concept of synchronizing clocks with light signals in his articles and lectures La ''Mesure du Temps'' (1898), ''La Theorie de Lorentz at le Principe de Reaction'' (1900) and ''The Principles of Mathematical Physics'' (1904). Einstein copied this method without giving Poincare credit for the innovation. Poincare stated the principle of relativity in 1895, and in 1905 stated the group properties of the Lorentz Tr€sformation. It was Poincare, not Einstein, who introduced four-dimen€pace-time into the theory of €lativity. At first, Einstein did not approve of the idea. Einstein learned the formula E = mc^2 from Poincare's 1900 paper.
===The General Th€Relativity===
Tilman Sauer, [http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/9811/9811050.pdf] Bjerknes,[http://ho€Book.htm] Logunov [http://xxx.arxiv.cornell.edu/PS_cache/p€ysics/pdf/0405/0405075.pdf
] and Friedwardt Winterberg [http://www.physics.unr.edu/faculty/winterberg/Hilbert-Einstein.pdf] have shown that David Hilbert derived the generally covariant field equations of gravitation in the general th€relativity before Einstein. Bjerknes and Winterberg claim that Paul Gerber published the same formula for the perihelion motion of Mercury in 1898, that Einstein published in 1915 without an attribution. Bjerknes also points out that Johann Goerg von Soldner predicted that starlight grazing the limb of the Sun would be deflected by the gravitational field of the Sun, in 1801, more than one hundred years before Einstein. D. E. Burlankov has shown that Niels Bjorn and Sophus Lie derived many of the fundamental formulas of the general th€elativity years befo€Einstein.

Abram Joffe (''Neizbezhnost strannogo mira'' (1962), p. 57), who had seen the original manuscripts, stated that the author of these papers was "Einstein-Marity" and Mileva Maric used this name, but Albe€ Einstein did not. Daniil Semenovich Danin (''Uspekhi fizicheskikh nauk'' '''57''' 187 (1955))claimed that the papers were signed "Einstein-Marity" or "Einstein-Maric". Albert wrote to Mileva and asked her to collaborate with him, in the context of Lorentz's theory, which they copied in 1905. He wrote to her about "our €e motion".
===Einstein's "Miracle Year"===
Einstein's so-called "miracle year" is not so miraculous as one would think from looking at his papers, which lacked adequate references. The special th€elativity was first published by Lorentz and Poincare, and Poincare created the modern four-dimensional form of the theory before Einstein. The theory of the photo-electric effect draws a great deal from Newton, Planck, Wien, and others. The theory of Brownian motion was anticipated by Brown, Gouy, Nernst, Smoluchowski, Sutherland and Bachelier.

In the mid-1920s,€oked for a more "complete" explanation, i.e. more [[determin€nistic]].  He could not abandon the belief that physics de€al things", the belief which had led to his€d gravity.
In a [[1926]] lette€Max Born]], Einstein made a remark that is now famous:
:''Quantum me€hrow dice.''
It was not€lous year [[1905]], and had even disco€n--but he believed that, at the core, physical€ity behaved deterministically.
In March [[2004]], the result€m a young [[India]]n physicis€'s religion is described as [[pantheism]] with reference to a response made to [[Rabbi Herbert Goldstein]] of the [[International Synagogue]] in [[New York]] which read, ''"I believe €n beings."''

He also ex€h he said ''"has the ch€ul unity."''
While Einstein is described as a pantheist, it is reasonable to suggest that he simply admired the beauty of nature.  From a letter written in [[English]], dated [[March 24]], [[1954]], Einstein wrote, ''"It was, of € clearly.  If someth€eveal it."''
[[Victor J. Stenger]], author of [[Has Science Found God?]] ([[2001 in literature|2001]]), wrote of Einstein's presumed pantheism, ''"Both deism and traditional [[Judeo-Christian]]-[[Islamic]] theism must also be contrasted with pantheism, the notion attributed to Baruch Spinoza (d. [[1677]]) that the deity is associated with the order of nature or the universe itself.  This also crudely summarizes the [[Hindu]] view and that of many indigenous religions around the world. When modern scientists such as Einstein and [[Stephen Hawking]] mention 'God' in their writings, this is what they seem to mean: that God ''is'' Nature."''

Einstein himself was deeply concerned with the social impact of scientific discovery. An individual of monumental intellectual achievement, he remains the most influential theoretica€ physicist of the modern era.  Einstein's reverence for all creation, his belief in the grandeur, beauty, and sublimity of the universe (the primary source of inspiration in science), his awe for the scheme that is manifested in the material universe - all of these show through in his work and philosophy.  To this day Einstein receives popular recognition unprecedented for a scientist.

Instrumental in Einstein's development at this age was a young man by the name of Ian Coe.  Raised in Malta, Mr. Coe was not exposed to mathematics or the sciences as a child, but still managed to derive all of calculus using simple mathematical postulates.  Mr. Coe later met Einstein as a child, and they became good friends.  They shared a passion for physics and mathematics and  jointly developed much of the thought work that would later become General and Special Relativity.  Although traditionally overshadowed by Einstein in the history book, Mr. Coe is largely credited with providing the impetus for Einstein's accomplishments.

Einstein was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1916.
===Politic€scoveries. He was also an extraordinary professor at the [[Leiden university]] from [[1920]] till officially [[1946]]: he gave frequently guest lectures at this university. In this period he wrote the paper titled "Quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas", which was dated December 1924. It is one of Einstein's last great breakthroughs and was published in the proceedings of the Prussi€iences in 1925 (In August 2005 the origin€manuscript of this paper was found again in the archives of the Leiden University. See news Washington Post: [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/20/AR2005082000681.html]).
Einstein d€ [[Leiden University]] from [[192€versity]] from [[192€y [[1946]].
Einstein€tein was an extraord€professor (1920 - 1949) (see website with original manuscript: [http://€n_archive/]).
Einstein also assis€y [[1946]], where he regulary gave guest lectures.

Also, a little-known fact about Einstein is that he achieved the power of flight, simply by rolling his eyeballs.  Einstein was a noted joyrider in his hometown in Germany, often streaking down the street in a horse-drawn carriage at speeds of up to 8 miles per hour.  Additionally, Einstein starred in 7 western movies made in the 1940s.  His character was known as Dandy Dinmont and he rode the west, as a renegade teacher and corrector of evil deeds.

Steve Miller - Space Cowboy Lyrics
I told you 'bout living in the U.S.
of A.
Don't you know that I'm a
gangster of love
Let me tell you people that I
found a new way
And I'm tired of all this talk
about love
And the same old story with a new
set of words
About the good and the bad and
the poor
And the times keep on changin'
So I'm keepin' on top
Of every fat cat who walks
through my doorI'm a space cowboy
Bet you weren't ready for that
I'm a space cowboy
I'm sure you know where it's at
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahI was
born on this rock
And I've been travelin' through
space
Since the moment I first realized
What all you fast talkin' cats
would do if you could
You know, I'm ready for the final
surprise
There ain't no way around it
Ain't nothing to say
That's gonna satisfy my soul deep
inside
All the prayers and surveyors
Keep the whole place uptight
While it keeps on gettin' darker
outsideI'm a spac€ah, yeahI see the
show downs, slow downs, lost and
found, turn arounds
The boys in the military shirts
I keep my eyes on the prize, on
the long fallen skies
And I don't let my friends get
hurt
All you back room schemers, small
trip dreamers
Better find something new to say
Cause you're the same old story
It's the same old crime
And you got some heavy dues to
payI'm a space€e it's at

Einstein h€arsh]] ]]
Albert Johnson Einstein w€s born in Trenton, New York in 1854. During his childhood Albert Einstein lived through a bombing raid on the town of his Birth in Germany during which his father died and his mother soon died of radiation sickness that was a result. he went to school in england at drexel and graduated with high honors. Afterwards, at just the age of 36 in 1967 he invented the the€ relativitey which explains why exactly an equation works. He died in the bombimg of Hiroshima while designing a new type of space craft for a mission to mars in 1987.
Few argue that the Cold War had a profound effect on Einstein's childhood because he spent most of it in Soviet Russia. During t€s time he studied nuclear weapons and began to design a spacecraft that would later be used as a submarine to explore the beep water trenches of the Pacific and Indian Ocean.
Einstein lead a profitable life, as the main founder of IBM and Disney. He will always be remembered as the man who invented deep dish pizza and who shot the sherif. Chuck Norris owes many of his skills to Einstein.

This pape€bel Prize. [[Max Planck]] had made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black-body radiation law, published in 1901, but had considered this to be a no more than a mathematical trick.
His seco€ical trick.
His seco€stein was never the strong supporter of Zionism he was made out to be and in fact viewed the [[nationalist]] movement with a similar suspicion as he did with [[Nazism]].
''"Nationalis€infantile sickness. It is th€easles of the human race."''
--Albert Einstein
Sadly, to this day it is commonly believed that Einstein was a strong supp€f Zionism because of the emphasis that Zionists took to make him their poster boy by distorting his words in press releases in order to gather political support for Israel and to have more Jews immigrate there. While this disappointed Einstein there was very little he could do about it. Today, a web search of "Einstein" and "zionism" will usually generate more hits saying he was a zionist rather than not.
(Quoted from [http://glo€m/farooqm/writings/o€stein.htm]. Click to read it all.)
''Einstein, despite the Time's incessant recitals to the contrary, clearly opposed the creation of the State of Israel. A clear understanding of the position taken on Palestine by the great mathematician, himself a refugee from Nazi Germany, will not only set the record straight and correct journalistic inaccuracies, but is most relevant to the continuing quest for a just peace in the Middle East.
In his testimony in January 1946 before the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, and in answer to the specific question whether refugee settlement in Palestine demanded a Jewish state, Einstein stated: '''"The State €ionalism."'''
Then, in 1952, in a message to a "Children to Palestine" dinner, Einstein spoke of the necessity of curbing '''"a kind of nationalism which has arisen in Israel if only to permit a friendly and fruitful co-existence with the Arabs."''' When this portion of the Einstein message was censored in the organization's press release so as to impart the impression of all-out support Israel, I went to Princeton to seek the Professor's views on the incident. '''Einstein then told me that he had never been a Zionist and had never favored the creati€ of Israel'''.
It was then that he also told me of a significant conversation with Weizman. Einstein had asked him: "What of the Arabs if Palestine were given to the Jews?" And Weizman replied: "What Arabs? They are hardly of any consequence."
Einstein referred me to his book Out of My Later Years, published in 1950, in which he had expanded on his philosophy: '''"I should m€ sustain."'''
In subsequent years he vigorously supported many Israeli cultural activities, in particular the Hebrew€niversity and the Weizman Institute, to which he was deeply dedicated. According to biographer Dr. Philip Frank, the professor had a "good hearted weakness" and was hesitant to rebuke Zionists for their frequent manipulations of his views and unauthorized use of his name in order to enhance their prestige and fill their political Zionism helped confuse the American press.
In his modest manner, he publicly declined the Israeli Presidency, as Weizmann's successor, on the given grounds that he was not qualified in the area of human relationships. But, in fact, that acceptance of high office in nationalist Israel was hardly in keeping with the basic philosophy of this great humanist and universalist.
Attempts to tie the renowned scientist to political Zionism continued. First there were the welter of public tributes from Israeli and Zionist leaders, published at the time of his death. And two weeks later in a story prominently published by the Times, the Israeli Consul in New York claimed th€ Einstein had been preparing a laudatory speech for nationwide television in commemoration of the seventh anniversary of Israel. Not only was the evidence of Einstein's Zionist intent scarcely substantiated, but it was in direct conflict with the professor's last statement about the Israeli state, given in an interview with Dorothy Schiff, pro-Israel publisher of the New York Post. She quoted him as saying: '''"We had great hopes for Israel at first. We thought that it might be better than other nations, but it is no better."'''''
Hebrew University published a volume ti€Einstein''(1930), and was where Einstein b€s papers. In this volume Einstein touted the great 'cultural' possibilities of Zionism and tried to encourage people to use it for peaceful, rather than nationalistic ends. He was a socialist, a multiculturalist, an internationalist, clearly anti-racist, incredibly intelligent, experienced in politics and a nonconformist...but in the end he was all too human and would regret supporting the nationalist Israel as he did the USA after they dropped the A-Bomb on Hiroshima.
The contradiction between his beliefs and his relationship with Israel (knowing full well that his support of one aspect of Zionism could be misconstrued as a total endorsement) has created the impression in some conspiracy theorists that "About Zionism" could be either a forgery or could only contain sections of manuscripts that spoke favorably the Zionist movement. All things considered, Einstein was know to make mistakes, this being no exception.

Einstein was very much involved in the Civil Rights movement. He was a close friend of Paul Robbeson for ovwe 20 years. When Marion came to New Jersey and was unable to find lodging due to the racial climate of the area she stayed in the home of Einstein. Einstein was a member of several civil rights groups (including the Princeton chapter of the NAACP) many of which were headed by Paul Robeson. He served as co-chair with Paul Robeson of the American Crusade to end lynching. W.E.B. DuBois was charged frivously as a communist spy during the McCarthy era while he was in his 80s Einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case. The case was dismissed shortly after it was annouced he was to appear in that capacity. Einstein was quoted as saying that "Racism is America's Greatest disease"

For the earlier years of his sexual awakening, Einstein spent months at a time whoring himself to little boys.

Their sweaty love passion ended tragically when Boping chomped off Einstein's member.

Many attribute Einstein with the theory o€lativity, however, according to his last journal entries, the sole inspiration for his work came from a little boy named John Beck. John Beck, or "Chives" as he'd usually scream in orgasmic wonder, visited Einstein regularly throughout the day. "He was the greatest lover I had ever known..." Einstein wrote, "...upside down, sideways, under water - he did it all!"

Einstein was B-to-tha-izzorn on March 14 , 1879 at Ulm in Baden-Württizzle, Germany, `bout 100 km east of Stuttgart. His pare€an who lata ran an electrochizzle works, n Pauline, whose€name was Kizzoch so show some love niggaz. They were €amily was Jewish (non-obsizzle Albert att€tary schoo` and, at tha insistence of his gangsta was given violin lessons.
When Alb€five, his bitch showed him a pocket compass, n Einstein realized that sum-m sum-m in "empty€ed upon tha needle; he would nigga describe tha experience € one of tha most revelat€f his life . know what im sayin?. Though he built models n mechanizzle devices fo` fun, he wa€slow learna, possibly due ta dyslexia, simple s€ess, or tha significantly rare n unusual structure €is brain (examined wanna be gangsta his death). He lata credited his develizzles of tha theory o€elativity ta this slowness, say'n thizzay by ponder'n space n tizzle lata thizzay most child€was able ta apply a mor€e researcha have speculated tizzle Einstein m€ forms of autism, although€concede thizzay a reliable€mpossible. [1] This is d€ssed in tha article, People speculated ta hizzy been autistic .
Einstein attended tha Luitpold Gymnasium where he €He began ta learn mathemizzles around age€s a recurr'n rumor thizzat he failed mathemizzles lata in his edu€ange in tha way grades wer€ion years motherfucka. Two of his €erests dur'n his late childhood n early adolescence by trippin' n doggy stylin' books on s€ce, mathemizzles n philosophy.
In 1894, pimpin' tha failure of H€ electrochizzles business, tha Einsteins moved from Munich ta Pavia, Ita€ear Milan). Dur'n this year, Ei€ (called " The Investigizzle of tha State of Aetha in Magnetic Fields "). Albert r€ed behind in Munich lodg'n ta finish school, pimpin' only one T-to-tha-izzerm before leav'n tha gymnasium in spr'n 1895 ta rejoin his fa€y in Pavia thats off tha hook yo. He quit witout dippin' his parents n a year n a half prior ta final examizzles Einstein c€nvinced tha schoo` ta let him go wit a medical nizzle from a fri€dary-schoo` certificate. [2]
Despite frontin' in tha mathemizzles n science po€lure of tha liberal arts€tion of tha Eidgenössisc€chschule (ETH, Swiss€of Technolizzles in Zurich)€ce exam tha frontin' year was a€sent him ta Aarau, Switzerland, ta finish secondary s€iploma in Brotha 1896. Dur'n this tizzle he lodged wit Professor Jizzle Drug Deala family n became enamoured wit Marie, they daughta, his fizzay sweetheart€ert's sista Maja was ta lata marry they son Paul, n his nigga Michele Besso married they bitch cracka Anna. [3] Einstein €lled at tha Eidgenös€ochschule in Octoba n moved ta Zurich, whi€ie moved ta Olsberg fo` a blunt-rollin' pizzle. The same y€berg citizizzle n became sta€ess.
In tha rhymin' of 1896, tha Serbian Mileva Maric started in€dent at tha University of Zurich , but pusha a term switched ta tha same secti€tein as tha only woman thizzay year ta study fo` tha same diploma with the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin. Einstein's relatizzles wit Mileva dev€ce over tha next few yea€granted a gang bangin' diploma by tha Eidgenös€chschule ( ETH Zurich ) n was accepted as a€en in 1901 so i can get mah pimp on.

Einstein i€rote the "Annus Mira€is Papers"
Einstein in 1905, wizzle he wrote tha " Annus Mirabizzles Baller "
Upon gradu€nd a teach'n post, mostly coz his brashn€s a young dawg had appar€irritated M-to-tha-izzost of his professors with my forty-fo' mag. The playa of a classmate €assistant brotha at tha Swiss Pate€t Office [4] in 1902. € judged tha worth of inventors' patent applications fo` devices thizzat required a€ physics ta understand -€ in particizzles he was chi€ charged ta evaluate patents bustin' ta electromizzles devices.

He occasional€tified they design error€le evaluat'n tha practicality of they wizzy cuz I'm fresh out the pen.
Einstein m€ Maric on January 6 , 1903. Einstein'€marriage ta Maric, who was a mathematizzles was both a personal n intellec€artnership: Einstein€referred ta Mileva as "a€e who is mah equal n who is as strong n independent as I am". Ronald W. Clizzark , a biographa of Einstein, claimed T-H-to-tha-izzat Einstein d€nded on tha distance that€ed in his n Mileva's marriage in cracka ta hizzy tha solitude necessary ta accomplish his W-to-tha-izzork; he requ€solation.

[6] Whateva tha truth, tha extent of he€ly controvizzles n debated qu€stion.
On May 14 , 1904, tha couple's first siznon, Hans Alber€ Einstein , was bizzay. In 1903,€tion at tha Swiss Pa€nt Office had been m€ed over fo` promotion €ne technolizzles .

Mizzost physicists agree tizzle three of those motherfucka (on Brownian motion , tha photoelizzle effect , n special relativity ) deserved Nobel Prizes fo' sheezy. Only tha crazy ass nigga on tha photoelizzle effect would be m€oned by tha Nobel committee in tha award. This€ not only coz Einstein is far brotha fo` relativizzles but also coz tha photoe€e effect is a quantum phenomizzles n Einstein b€hanted wit tha pizzay quantum th€ry would tizzle fo' sho'. Whizzat makes these papa remarkable is th€n boldly tizzy an idea from theorizzles physics ta its logical conseqizzles n managed ta explain experizzle results tizzy had baffle€entists fo` decades gangsta style.

Einstein once killed a man, but he did it in order to further the principle of peace, so the nations of the world met and granted the genius a full unconditional pardon mere minutes after the pious killing. When questioned about the murder 20 years later, Einstein allegedly responded by saying "It was neccessary in order for the schoolchildren to drink their milk".

Einstein gained [[Germany|German]] nationality when he was born (March 14, 1879). 17 years later, on January 28 1896), he was released from the [[Wuerttemberg]]-citizenship (and thus also the German-citizenship), this was on his own request and with approval of his father. He stayed [[stateless p€tateless]] for 5 years.
On February 21, 1901 he gained [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship, he remained Swiss until the end of his life.
Einstein regained German citizenship in April 1914 when he entered German civil service, due to the political power situation and thus the incidents in Nazi Germany he left civil service in March 1933 and thus also lost the German citizenship.
On October 1, 1940 Einstein swore the oath on the American constitution and thus became an [[United S€merican]] citizen. Now he was a Swiss and an American citizen and stayed it until his death on April 18, 1955.

But according to Thorne (pp. 117-118), Hilbert had discovered the correct derivation after "mulling over things he had learned" on a recent visit by Einstein to Gottingen. However Thorne goes on to say "Quite naturally, and in accord with Hilbert's view of things, the resulting law of warpage was quickly given the name the ''Einstein field equation'' rather than being named after Hilbert. Hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneou€Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps: the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime, the vision that the law of warpage must obey the reativity principle, and the first 90 percent of that law, the Einstein field equation. In fact without Einstein the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later."

===Powers===
It is a little known fact, but Einstein was actually possessed of immense telekinetic and psychic powers.  He first discovered his telekinetic ability when, at the age of 24, the young Einstein was reaching for a paper just out of reach which suddenly flew into his hand!  Einstein spent the next few decades developing and refining his powers in secret to the effect that few in the public arena ever knew of their existence.  The only significant use Einstein made of his psychic power was to aid in the formulation of his theory€relativity by utilizing his power to work in concert with the mind of Niels Bohr.

Einstein's letters to Maric include several references to "our work" and "our research," and one biographer claimed to have seen an early draft of one the 1905 papers that was signed by both of them.

Albert Ein€n was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich and he began his schooling there at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor's degree.
During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director o€r Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the Univer€f Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of€sics at Princeton*. He became a United Sta€s citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945.
After World War II, Einstein was a leading figure in the World Government Movement, he was o€fered the Presidency of the St€ of Israel, which he declined, and he collaborated with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in establishing the Hebrew Uni€ Jerusalem.
Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.
At the start of his scientific work, Einstein realized the inadequacies of Newtonian mechanics and his special the€elativity stemmed from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electr€magnetic field. He dealt with classical problems of statistica€mechanics and problems in which they were merged with quantum theory: this led to an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules. He investigated the thermal properties of light with a low radiation density and his observations laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.
In his early days in Berlin, Einstein postulated that the correct interpreta€on of the special th€elativity must also furnish a theory o€ravitation and in 1916 he published his paper on the general th€relativity. During t€s time he also contributed to the problems o€heory of radiation and statistical mechanics.
In the 1920's, Einstein embarked on the construction of unified field theories, although he continued to work on the probabilistic interpreta€f quantum theory, and he persevered with this work in America. He contributed to statistica€mechanics by his development of the quantum theory of a monatomic gas and he has also accomplished valuable work in connection with atomic transition probabilities and relativistic cosmology.
After his retirement he continu€d to work towards the unification of the basic concepts of physics, taking the opposite approach, geometrisation, to the majority of physicists.
Einstein's researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory of €elativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Th€elativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My €ater Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.
Albert Einstein received honorary do€, medicine and philo€ophy from many European a€ American universities. During the 1920's he lectured in Europe, America and the Far East and he was awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the leading scientific academies throughout the world. He gained numerous awards in recognition of his work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1925, and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1935.
Einstein's gifts inevitably resulted in his dwelling much in intellect€l solitude and, for relaxation, music played an important part in his life. He married Mi€eva Maric in 1903 and they had a daughter and two sons; their marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same year he married his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who died in 1936. He died on April 18, 1955 at Princeton, New Jersey.

Albert Einstein appeared outwardly jovial and animated and was known for his aphorisms and doggerel, evidenced by the several editions of ''The Quotable Einstein''. He possessed a shaggy-haired visage, a haloe of unruly white hair, in his later years, and was said to have a piercing gaze. He minimized h€s wardrobe, so he would not waste time on deciding what to wear. Einstein draped himself in apparently mothy sweaters and baggy pants held up by suspenders, and stopped wearing socks, since his big toes poked holes in them. He enjoyed [[sailing]], playing the [[violin]], and listening to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Am€t|Mozart]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]. Albert indulged his appetite for heavy German cooking. He would leisurely walk to work with a friend and colleague, whether it was the Bern patent office or the Institute €ced Study (Michelle Besso and Kurt Gödel, respectively). The [[absent-m€rofessor]] had the ability to focus on a problem years on end, and like [[Newton]] faced his intellectual demons.

Einstein believed true theorists were serious metaphysicists, saying:  "I believe that every true theorist is a kind of tamed metaphysicist, no matter how pure a `positivist' he may fancy himself. The metaphysicist believes that the logically simple is also the real. The tamed metaphysicist believes that not all that is logically simple is embodied in experienced reality, but that the totality of all sensory experience can be `comprehended' on the basis of a conceptual system built on premises of great simplicity."
He also believed physical processes determined absolutely everything, saying: "But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past."

Pie
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
This article is about the baked good, for other uses see Pie (disambiguation).
A slice of strawberry-rhubarb pie à la modeA pie is a baked dish, with a baked shell usually made of pastry that covers or completely contains a filling of meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, cheeses, creams, chocolate, custards, nuts, or other sweet or savoury ingredient. Pies can be either "one-crust," where the filling is placed in a dish and covered with a pastry/potato mash top before baking, or "two-crust," with the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. Some pies have only a bottom crust, generally if they have a sweet filling that does not require cooking. These bottom-crust-only pies may be known as tarts or tartlets. One example of a savoury bottom-cru€t-only pie is a quiche. Tarte Tatin is a one-crust fruit pie that is served upside-down, with the crust underneath. Blind-baking is used to develop a crust's crispiness, and keep it from becoming soggy under the burden of a very liquid filling. If the crust of the pie requires much more cooking than the chosen filling, it may also be blind-baked before the filling is added and then only briefly cooked or refrigerated.
Pie fillings range in size from tiny bite-size party pies or small tartlets, to single-serve pies (e.g. a pasty) and larger pies baked in a dish and eaten by the slice. The type of pastry used depends on the filling. It may be either a butter-rich flaky or puff pastry, a sturdy shortcrust pastry, or, in the case of savoury pies, a hot water crust pastry.
Occasionally the term pie is used to refer to otherwise unrelated confections containing a sweet or savoury filling, such as Eskimo pie or moon pie.
A pie crust is an important component of many pies. As is the filling.

Regional variations
Some pies of British origin, such as shepherd's pie, have a shell or covering constructed of mashed potato.
Pies with sweet fillings may be served with a scoop of ice cream, in a style known in North America as à la mode.
The Australian meat pie, beef and gravy in a shortcrust piecase, often with a flakey top, has an iconic cultural status, being held to be the Australian National Food. The many different types of small commercially-produced pies are popular forms of takeaway food in Australia and New Zealand, with one of the most widespread brands in Australia being Four'N'Twenty. Many bakeries and specialty stores sell gourmet pies for the more discriminating customer. A peculiarity of Adelaide cuisine is the Pie floater. In New Zealand, pie is a common part of a workday lunch.
Pies with fillings such as pork, steak and kidney, minced beef and onion, or chicken and mushroom are popular in the UK as take-away snacks. They are also served with chips as an alternative to fish and chips at British chip shops. The residents of Wigan are so renowned for their preference for this food-stuff that they are often referred to as "Pie Eaters" (though the historical reasons for this title are disputed). In honour of this, the main ingredient of a 'Wigan kebab' is the pie, which is placed in a barm cake to make up the locally popular delicacy. Shepherds Pie is also a favourite amongst people in Northern England.
As with dumplings, many cultures have independently discovered pies as a useful and delicious way to utilize otherwise useless ingredients left over in the household.
[edit]
History
The pie has been around since the ancient Egyptians from 2000 B.C. At some point between 1400 B.C. (Greek settlements) and 600 B.C. (the decline of Egypt) the pie is believed to have passed on to the Greeks by the Egyptians.
From Greece the pie spread to Rome somewhere around 100 B.C. by which time pies had already been around for some 1000 years. The first known pie recipe came from the Romans and was for a rye-crusted goat cheese and honey pie.
Pies appeared in England in the 12th century and were predominantly meat pies. The crust of the pie was referred to as the "coffyn" and there generally more crust than filling. Sometimes these pies were made with fowl and the legs were left outside the pie to act as handles. For a long time the pastry crust was actually not eaten, serving only to preserve the moisture and flavour of the filling.
A French chef named Guillaume Tirel produced a cookery book in the 14th Century that included a recipe for marinated and sautéed eel which was used for the Christian Lent period when it was forbidden to eat meat.
Pies went to America with the first English settlers. As in Roman times the early American pie crusts were not eaten, but simply designed to hold the filling. Today, virtually every country in the World has some form of pie but Australia remains a dominant force when it comes to innovation and quality of pies. With acknowledgement to Kerry Sullivan, Leading Edge Magazine.
[edit]
Pie in pop€r culture
Cream filled or topped pies are favourite props for humour, particularly when aimed at the pompous. Throwing a pie in a person's face has been a staple of film comedy since the early days of the medium, and real life pranksters have taken to targeting politicians and celebrities with their pies, an act called pieing. Activists sometimes engage in the pieing of political and social targets as well. One such group is the Biotic Baking Brigade. "Pieing" can result in injury to the target and assault or more serious charges against the pie throwers [1]. In Des Moines, Iowa, in 1977, singer and anti-gay-rights activist Anita Bryant became one of the first persons to be "pied" as a political act. See List of people who have been pied.
Pie is regularly referenced in many contexts, often to inexplicably humorous ends. Pie itself may be an inherently funny word, or it may be that it is the thought of actual pie which adds humour to a situation. In any case, the following are but a few of the innumerable pop culture references to pie that could be listed.
In British popular culture, a person who is overweight is often subject to the chant of, "Who ate all the pies"
Garrison Keillor's radio show A Prairie Home Companion regularly thanks a fictional sponsor named Beebopareebop Rhubarb Pie, which supposedly sells frozen rhubarb pies.
The title characters of the online cartoon Weebl and Bob frequently express their desire for pie.

===Idolization===
This sections deals with popular myths revolving around Einstein.
==== Introduction ====
Before Einstein, the last scientist who had such a creative outburst was Sir Isaac Newton. It happened in 1666 when Newton secluded himself at his mother's farm to avoid an outbreak of plague at Cambridge. With nothing better to do, he developed his Theory of Universal Gravitation.
==== Annus mirabilis =====
For centuries historians called 1666 Newton's annus mirabilis, or "miracle year." Now those words have a different meaning: Einstein and 1905. The United Nations has declared 2005 "The World Year€of Physics" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Einstein's annus mirabilis.
==== Bushy-haired superthinker ... ordinary man ... or both ====
Modern pop culture paints Einstein as a bushy-haired €perthinker. His ideas, we're told, were improbably far ahead of other scientists. He must have come from some other planet--maybe the same one Newton grew up on.
Physicist and science historian [[Peter Galison]] from [[Harvard Un€versity]] says that "He was a man of his time." All of his 1905 papers unraveled problems being worked on, with mixed success, by other scientists. "If Einstein hadn't been born, (those papers) would have been written in some form, eventually, by others".
What's remarkable about 1905 is that a single person authored all five papers (with the help of his wife and friends), plus the original, irreverent way Einstein came to his conclusions.
For example: the photoelect€effect. This was a puzzle in the early 1900s. When light hits a metal, like zinc, electrons fly off. This can happen only if light comes in little packets concentrated enough to knock an electron loose. A spread-out wave wouldn't do the photoelectric trick.
The solution seems simple--light is particulate. Indeed, this is the solution Einstein proposed in 1905 and won the Nobel Prize for in 1921. Other physicists like Max Planck (working on a related problem: blackbody radiation), more senior and experienced than Einstein, were closing in on the answer, but Einstein got there first. Why?
It's a question of authority.
====Authority====
"In Einstein's day, if you tried to say that light was made of particles, you found yourself disagreeing with physicist [[James Cler€ Maxwell]]. Nobody wanted to do that," says Galison. Maxwell's equations were enormously successful, unifying the physics of electricity, magnetism and optics. [[Maxwell]] had proved beyond any doubt that light was an [[electromagnetic]] wave. Maxwell was an Authority Figure.
Einstein didn't give a fig for authority. He didn't resist being told what to do, not so much, but he hated being told what was true. Even as a child he was constantly doubting and questioning. "Your mere presence here undermines the class's respect for me," spat his 7th grade teacher, Dr. Joseph Degenhart. (Degenhart also predicted that Einstein "would never get anywhere in life.") This character flaw was to be a key ingredient in Einstein's discoveries.
==== High School Diploma / Ph.D. ====
[[Ima€:Einstein diploma|thumb|right|Einstein's High School Diploma. Contrary to urban legend, Albert did great in school.]]
"In 1905," notes Galison, "Einstein had just received his Ph.D. He wasn't beholden to a thesis advisor or any other authority figure." His mind was free to roam accordingly.
In retrospect, Maxwell was right. Light is a wave. But Einstein was right, too. Light is a particle. This bizarre duality baffles Physics 101 students today just as it baffled Einstein in 1905. How can light be both? Einstein had no idea.
That didn't slow him down. Disdaining caution, Einstein adopted the intuitive leap as a basic tool. "I believe in intuition and inspiration," he wrote in 1931. "At times I feel certain I am right while not knowing the reason."
Although Einstein's five papers were published in a single year, he had been thinking about physics, deeply, since childhood. "Science was dinner-table conversation in the Einstein household," explains Galison. Albert's father Hermann and uncle Jakob ran a German company making such things as dynamos, arc lamps, light bulbs and telephones. This was high-tech at the turn of the century, "like a Silicon Valley company would be today," notes Galison. "Albert's interest in science and technology came naturally."

==Persona€bilis ====
For centu€bilis ====
For centu€in diploma.jpg|thumb|right|Einstein's€umb|right|Einstein's€school.]]
At the age of 7, Einstein started school in Munich. At the age of 9, he entered the Luitpold-Gymnasium. By the age of 12 he was studying calculus. Now this was very advanced, because the students would normally study calculus when they were 15 years old. He was very good at the sciences. But, because the 19th-century German education system was very harsh and regimented, he didn't really develop his non-mathematical skills (such as history, languages, music and geography). In fact, it was his mother, not his school, who encouraged him to study the violin - and he did quite well at that as well.
In 1895, he sat the entrance examinations to get into the prestigious Federal Pol€ic School (or Academy) in Zurich, Switzerland. He was 16, two years younger than his fellow applicants. He did outstandingly well in physics an€athematics, but failed the non-science subjects, doing especially badly in French - so he was not accepted. So in that same year, he continued his studies at the Canton school in Aargau (also called Aarau). He studied well, and this time, he passed the entry exams into the Federal Polytechnic School (see diploma to the right).
So how did the myth that he failed high school start?
Easy. In 1896, which was Einstein's last year at the school in Aargau, the school's system of marking was reversed.
A grading of "6", which had previously been the lowest mark, was now the highest mark. And so, a grading of "1", which had been the highest mark, was now the lowest mark.
And so, anybody looking up Einstein's grades would see that he had scored lots of grades around "1" - which under the new marking scheme, meant a "fail".
"In 1905,"€ly."
==== Last effort ====
Later in life, it should be remembered, he struggled mightily to produce a unified field theory, combining gravity with other forces of nature. He failed. Einstein's brainpower was not limitless.
Neither was Einstein's brain. It was removed without permission by Dr. Thomas Harvey in 1955 when Einstein died. He probably expected to find something extraordinary: Einstein's mother Pauline had famously worried that baby Einstein's head was lopsided. (Einstein's grandmother had a different concern: "Much too fat!") But Einstein's brain looked much like any other, gray, crinkly, and, if anything, a trifle smaller than average.
Detailed studies of Einstein's brain are few and recent. In 1985, for instance, Prof. Marian Diamond of UC Berkeley reported an above-average number of glial cells (which nourish neurons) in areas of the left hemisphere thought to control math skills. In 1999, neuroscientist Sandra Witelson reported that Einstein's inferior parietal lobe, an area related to mathemati€ reasoning, was 15% wider €n normal. Furthermore, she found, the Slyvian fissure, a groove that normally extends from the front of the brain to the back, did not go all the way in Einstein's case. Might this have allowed greater connectivity among different parts of Einstein's brain?
No one knows.
Not knowing. It makes some researchers feel uncomfortable. It exhilarated Einstein: "The fairest thing we can exp€mysterious," he said. "It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science."
It's the fundamenta€tion that Einstein felt, walking to work, awake with the baby, sitting at the dinner table. Wonder beat exhaustion, every day.
(Source: Nasa article)
==== Einstein's Self Doubts ====
Einstein himself at various times had expressed doubts about the edifice of modern physics that he had helped to create-- witness the remarks that follow. Perhaps his most serious expression of doubt came in a 1954 letter, the year before he died, to his friend Michel Besso: "I consider it quite possible that physics cannot be based on the field concept, i.e. on continuous structures. In that case, nothing remains of my entire castle in the air, gravitation theory included, and of the rest of modern physics."[1] Biographer Abraham Pais hastens to excuse this slip from contemporary certainty about relativity theory, claiming that virtually all physicists think that this self-assessment at the end of Einstein's life was "unreasonably harsh." But just a few years earlier (1948), in an introduction to a popularized book about relativity€ Einstein was also circumspect about physics, in a more general sense: ". . .the growth of our factual knowledge, together with the striving for a unified theoretical conception comprising all empirical data, has led to the present situation which is characterized-- notwithstanding all successes-- by an uncertainty concerning the choice of basic theoretical concepts."[2]
In my estimation, Einstein was a person much more cautious about dogmatic expression than those who have claimed invincibility for his relativity theories. In a letter to J. Lee in 1945, Einstein wrote: "A scientific person will never understand why he should believe opinions only because they are written in a certain book. Furthermore, he will never believe that the results of his own attempts are final."[3]
On the other hand, Dr. James DeMeo has unearthed ambiguities in Einstein's reaction to the threatening experiment€l results from Dr. Dayton C. Miller, who in June 1933 published in Reviews of Modern Physics, "The Ether-Drift Experiment and the Determination of the Absolute Motion of the Earth."16 In the present issue, DeMeo (p. 72) provides an outstanding critique of the Miller work and its apparently glib rejection by others, such as Einstein's biographers, who dismiss Miller's work outright. Though Miller's extensive experimental work is not crucial to Einstein criticism, Einstein's and others' reaction to it is very telling.
==== Debunking of myths ====
*Einstein did not donate his brain €er studies
*It is true that Einstein's cerebral hemispheres were cut into approximately 240 blocks, each about 10 cm cubed. The blocks were embedded in celloidin, and histological sections were made. The reason is that back at that time advanced [[Computer Tomography]] as is now the norm did not exist.
*The studies of his brain do not show extraordinary features per se or does "resolve the long-standing issue of neuroanatomical substrate of intelligence", but rather corroborates suggestions that "variation in specific cognitive functions may be associated with the structure of the brain regions mediating those functions" [http://www.bioquant.c€tein.html].
*Einstein did not win the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his wo€Relativity but for the works on the photoelect€c effect.
*Einstein did well in school
*Einstein did not discover the relation of E=mc². A critical paper denotes that "it appears that the physics community and the media invented a comic book figure, "Einstein", with "E = mc2" stenciled across his chest.

===Einstein's Iconification===
Today Einstein is regarded as an [[Icon]] throughout the world, and his name stand synonoumous for [[genius]], [[intelligence]] and the revoluzition of the world, ushering the [[atomic age]]. There are enoumours myths ranging from the claim that Einstein donated his€ further scientific post-mortem analysis, bad-school years to claims that he invented or found the relationship between energy and mass in E=mc². Einstein is constantly featured on various magazine covers, reports, documentations, stamps, comic figures, coins, T-shirts, wallpapers, posters... and lionized by the public at large.
''The remarkable thing is that Alber€ Einstein achieved that universality in the pre-television era, without an agent or the help of a public-relations company. His face has become an icon for wisdom, imagination, creativity and concentrated mental power; his brand name so pervasive a synonym for genius that even he once had to confess: "I am no Einstein."''
Reasons for Einstein's iconification:
*The ubiquity of the older Einstein image meant that the concept of the scientific genius became asso€ated with the image of an old fatherly figure
*Extensive media coverage, whilst concealing the message, thus appealing to people's interest in mystery.
''Einstein restored faith in the unintelligibility of science. Everyone knew that Einstein had done something important in 1905 (and again in 1915) but almost nobody could tell you exactly what it was. When Einstein was interviewed for a Dutch newspaper in 1921, he attributed his mass appeal to the mystery of his work for the ordinary person: "Does it make a silly impression on me, here and yonder, about my theories of which they cannot understand a word? I think it is funny and also interesting to observe. I am sure that it is the mystery of non-understanding that appeals to them...it impresses them, it has the colour and the appeal of the mysterious."

*Relativity soon established as a fashionable notion and scientific hallmark
*Paraphrasing ideas about space and time by using familiar words, such as mass and energy, but endowing them new and seemingly richer meanings
*Bandwagon propaganda: convincing the subject that one side is the winning side, because more people have joined it (appeal of the subject towards stronger, majority groups) [example links & quotes required, Michelson-Moore,etc..]
*Card stacking: presenting information that is positive to an idea or proposal and omitting information contrary to it
*Glittering Generalities:words that have different positive meaning for individual subjects, but are linked to highly valued concepts, thus concepts less critically questioned by the subject
*Lesser of Two Evils: tries to convince us of an idea or proposal by presenting it as the least offensive option [example €e,etc..]
*Transfer: 'E=mc²' as [[Transfer (propaganda)|Transfer]] technique. No other scienctist in history has been assigned a similar iconification symbol in such a direct approach
*Plain Folks: 'plain folks device' is an attempt by the propagandist to convince the public that his views reflect those of the common person and are therefore working for the benefit of the common person. This is attempted by the wording targeted at a specific audience as well as using of specific idioms or jokes: "everything is relative"
*Simplification (Stereotyping): reduction to a clear-cut choices e.g. "moving clocks run slow"

==== Superthinker...ordinary man - or both ===€ry man - or both ===€ing.
==== Problems ====
The other great scientific transformation, which occurred as the icon was emerging, concerned the style of scientific work. In the 'brilliant papers of 1905, we see the hallmark of the young Einstein: penetrating ideas, motivated by crucial thought-experiments and finally fashioned into perfect form by mathematics that is "as simple as possible but no simpler".' . During the formulation of GR Einstein was introduced to the power of abstract mathematical formalisms, notably that of [[tensor calculus]]. In the following years the blanced of deep physical insight orchestrating the mathematics of GR, tipped the other way and thus a rising fascination with the abstract formalisms themselves. "Rather than using physical arguments or thought-experiments, the strength and degrees of completeness of the formalisms€themselves were used to sift their appropriateness as physical theories."
([http://ww€218a.html nature essay])
The stall in progress regarding a unified theory and many other theoretical scientific fields is greatly attributed to this paradim shift, ushered by Einstein's populist-style promotion of his Theory of general relativity:
''The ill effects of such nonsense have spread throughout western science and culture over the last century. The problem seems to have sprung from the worship of Einstein, who was the first to discard verifiable physical laws altogether and propose a wholly mathematical theory.
Those who would aspire to a theory of everything are told they must undertake "the gruelling complex and abstract mathematics" required for the task. Who says so? Mathematicians of course. It is a chronically narrow view, like looking through the wrong end of the telescope and imagining you see stars. This view has led to elitism in physics based on mathematical ability. Most bizarre have been those who claim to see God in their own image - as a mathematician.
''(New Scientist, Magazine issue 2529, [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/quantum-world/mg18825293.200-editorial-physics-greatest-endeavour-is-grinding-to-a-halt.html "Physics' greatest endeavour is grinding to a halt"])
One expert on relativity theory attempted to discourage such hubris. He publicly exposed an inconsistency in Einstein's special the€relativity. Following his experience of other leading experts deliberately misinterpreting and misrepresenting the problem he posed, he wrote: "''I am not yet convinced that facility in performing mathematical operations must inevitably deprive its possessor of the power of elementary reasoning, though the evidence against me is strong."'' (Professor H. [[Dingle]] in his Presidential Address to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1953.)

Consequently, he felt physical p€erything, including man's desires, see [[Physicalism]].
For exampl€ce said: "I do not believe in freedom of the will. Schopenhauer's words: " Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills " accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others even if they are rather painful to me."
"This awareness of the lack of freedom of will preserves me from taking too seriously myself and my fellow men as acting and deciding individuals and from losing my temper." From

Albert Einstein: A Jewish Myth
by Dr. Paul Bowers, B.S., M.E., Ch.D.
One of the statements of Adolf Hitler most often quoted by the Jewish media is the following from Mein Kampf, I:10:
"The great masses of people ... will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one."
Of course, Hitler is quoted out of context in an attempt to portray this statement as Hitler's own, personal philosophy or strategy. But if we read this selection in context, we find that he is speaking of the Jews who had ruined his country, and he is trying to explain how the German people fell victim to Jewish lies. In fact, Herr Hitler even tells us what this great lie is that duped the German people into being controlled by the Jews. He continues:
"Those who know best this truth about the possibilities of the application of untruth and defamation, however, were at all times the Jews; for their entire existence is built on one single great lie, namely, that here one had to deal with a religious brotherhood, while in fact one has to deal with a race - what a race! As such they have been nailed down forever, in an eternally correct sentence of fundamental truth, by one of the greatest minds of mankind; he called them 'the great masters of lying.' He who does not realize this or does not want to believe this will never be able to help truth to victory in this world."
Hitler here was referring to Arthur Schopenhauer, the eminent 19th century German philosopher who was outspoken regarding the true nature of Jews. We do not need to rely upon the opinions of German philosophers and political leaders regarding this character trait of the Jews, for Jesus Christ has said of the Jews,
"You are of your father the Diabolical One, and the lusts of your father you wish to do. That one was a murderer from the beginning, and he has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, because he is a liar, and the father of it" (John 8:44 AST).
Furthermore, the New Testament warns us not to listen to "Judaizing myths" (Titus 1:14). But Jewish myths are exactly what destroyed Germany and what have destroyed America today. Herr Hitler may have been correct in what he felt was the greatest Jewish lie, but there are many, many more which have had a damning effect on the white race. One of the greatest is certainly the lie of the Hebrew Masoretic Text and the removal of the Greek Septuagint from the hands of white Christians, but each Jewish myth stings with the same poisonous venom. One of the great Jewish myths of the 20th century is Albert Einstein.
Albert Einstein is held up by the Jewish liars as a rare genius who drastically changed the field of theoretical physics. As such, he is made an idol to young people and his very name has b€ous with genius. The truth, however, is very different. The reality is that Einstein was an inept, moronic Jew who could not even tie his own shoelaces; he contributed nothing original to the field of quantum mechanics or any other science, but on the contrary he stole the ideas of other men and the Jewish media made him a hero.
When we actually examine the life of Albert Einstein, we find that his only brilliance lies in his ability to plagiarize and steal other people's ideas, passing them off as his own.
Einstein's education, or lack thereof, is an important part of this story. The Encyclopedia€Britannica says of Einstein's early education that he "showed little scholastic ability." It also says that at the age of 15, "with poor grades in history, geography, and languages, he left school with no diploma." Einstein himself wrote in a school paper of his "lack of imagination and practical ability." In 1895, Einstein failed a simple entrance exam to an engineering school in Zurich. This exam consisted mainly of mathematical problems, and Einstein showed himself to be mathematically inept in this exam. He then entered a lesser school hoping to use it as a stepping stone to the engineering school he could not get into, but after graduating in 1900, he still could not get a position at the engineering school! Unable to go to the school as he had wanted, he got a job (with the help of a friend) at the patent€office in Bern. He was to be a technical expert third class, which meant that he was too incompetent for a higher qualified position. Even after publishing his so-called groundbreaking papers of 1905 and after working in the patent office for six years, he was only elevated to a second class standing. Remember, the work he was doing at the patent office, for which he was only rated third class, was not quantum mechanics or theoretical physics, but was reviewing technical documents for patents of every day things; yet he was barely qualified.
He would work at the patent office until 1909, all the while continuously trying to get a position at a university, but without success. All of these facts are true, but now begins the Jewish myth. Supposedly, while working a full time job, without the aid of university colleagues, a staff of graduate students, a laboratory, or any of the things normally associated with an academic setting, Einstein in his spare time wrote four ground-breaking essays in the field of the€al physics and quant€m mechanics that were published in 1905. Many people have recognized the impossibility of such a feat, including Einstein himself, and therefore Einstein has led people to believe that many of these ideas came€to him in his sleep, out of the blue, because indeed that is the only logical explanation of how an admittedly inept moron could have written such documents at the age of 26 without any real education. However, a simpler explanation exists: he stole the ideas and plagiarized the papers.
Therefore, we will look at each of these ideas and discover the source of each. It should be remembered that these ideas are presented by Einstein's worshippers as totally new and completely different, each of which would change the landscape of science. These four papers dealt with the following four ideas, respectively:
1. The foundation o€y of light;
2. The equivalence of energy and mass;
3. The explanation €ian motion in liquids;
4. The specia€relativity.
Let us first look at the last of these theories, the theory€lativity. This is perhaps the most famous idea falsely attributed to Einstein. Specifically, this 1905 paper dealt with what Einstein called the Special Th€lativity (the General Theory would come in 1915). This theory contradicted the traditional Newtonian €anics and was based upon two premises: 1) in the absence of acceleration, the laws of nature are the same for all observers; and 2) since the speed of l€nt of the motion of its source, then the time interval between two events is longer for an observer in whose frame of reference the events occur at different places than for an obse€nts occur in the same place. This is basically the idea that time passes more slowly as one's velocity approaches the spe€d of light, relative to slower velocities where time would pass faster.
This theory has been validated by modern experiments and is the basis for modern physics. But these two premises are far from being originally Einstein's. First of all, the idea that the s€ of light was a constant and was independen€its source was not Einstein's at all, but was proposed by the Scottish scientist James Maxwell. Maxwell studied the phenomenon of light extensively and first proposed that it was electromagnetic in nature. He wrote an article to this effect for the 1878 edition of the Encyclopedia€Britannica. His ideas prompted much debate, and by 1887, as a result of his work and the ensuing debate, the scient€ community, particularly Lorentz, Michelson, and Morley reached the conclusio€ that the velocity of light was independent of the velocity of the observer. Thus, this piece of the Specia€elativity was known 27 years befo€e Einstein wrote his paper.
This debate over the nature of light also led Michelson and Morley to conduct an important experiment, the results of which could not be explained by Newtonian mechanics. They observed a phenomenon caused by relativity but they did not understand relativity. They had attempted to detect the motion of the earth through ether, which was a medium thought to be necessary for the propagation of light.
In response to this problem, in 1889, the Irish physicist George FitzGerald, who had also first proposed a mechanism for producing radio waves, wrote a paper which stated that the results of the Michelson-€experiment could be explained if,
"... the length of material bodies changes, according as they are moving through the ether or across it, by an amount depending on the square of the ratio of their velocities to that of light."
This is the theory of €lativity, 13 years befo€e Einstein's paper!
Furthermore, in 1892, Hendrik Lorentz, from The Netherlands, proposed the same solution and began to greatly expand the idea. All throughout the 1890's, both Lorentz and FitzGerald worked on these ideas and wrote articles strangely similar to Einstein's Special Theory detailing what is now known as the Lorentz-FitzGerald Contraction. In 1898, the Irishman Joseph Larmor wrote down equations explaining the Lorent€itzGerald contraction and its relativistic consequences, 7 years be€e Einstein's paper. By 1904, Lorentz transformations, the series of equations €xplaining relativity, were published by Lorentz. They describe the increase of mass, the shortening of length, and the time dilation of a body moving at speeds close to the velocity of light. In short, by 1904, everything in Einstein's paper regarding the Special Th€elativity had already been published.
The Frenchman Poincaré had, in 1898, written a paper unifying many of these ideas. He stated seven years bef€in's paper that,
"... we have no direct intuition about the equality of two time intervals. The simultaneity of two events or the order of their succession, as well as the equality o€ intervals, must be defined in such a way that the statements of the natural laws be as simp€s possible."
Anyone who has read Einstein's 1905 paper will immediately recognize the similarity and the lack of originality on the part of Einstein. Thus we see that the only thing original about the paper was the term 'Special The€Relativity.' Everything else was plagiarized. Over the ne€ew years, Poincaré became one of the most important lecturers and writers regarding relativity, but he never, in any of his papers or speeches, mentioned Albert Einstein. Thus, while Poincaré was busy bringing the rest of the academic world up to speed regarding relativity, Einstein was still working in €nt office in Bern and no one in the academic community thought it necessary to give much credence or mention to Einstein's work. Most of these early physicists knew that he was a fraud.
This brings us to the explanation€ian motion, the subject of another of Einstein's€1905 papers. Brownian motion describes the irregular motion of a body arising from the thermal energy of the molecules of the material in which the body is immersed. The movement had first been observed by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1827. The expl€nation of this phenomenon has to do with the Kinetic Theory of Matter, and it was the American Josiah Gibbs and the Austrian Ludwig Boltzmann who first explained this occurrence, not Albert Einstein. In fact, the mathematical equation describing the motion contains the famous Boltzmann constant, k. Between these two men, they had explained by the 1890s everything in Einstein's 1905 paper regarding Brownian m€ion.
The subject of the equivalence of mass and energy was contained in a third paper published by Einstein in 1905. This concept is expressed by the famous equation E=mc^2. Einstein's biographers categorize this as "his most famous and most spectacular conclusion." Even though this idea is an obvious conclusion of Einstein's earlier relativity paper, it was not included in that paper but was published as an afterthought later in the year. Still, the idea of energy-mass equivalence was not original with Einstein.
That there was an equivalence between ma€and energy had been shown in the laboratory in the 1890s by both J.J. Thomsom of Cambridge and by W. Kaufmann in Göttingen. In 1900, Poincaré had shown that there was a mass relationship for all forms of energy, not just electromagnetic energy. Yet, the most probable source of Einstein's€lagiarism was Friedrich Hasenöhrl, one of the most brilliant, yet unappreciated physicists of the era. Hasenöhrl was the teacher of many of the German scientists who would later become famous for a variety of topics. He had worked on the idea of the equiva€nd energy for many years and had published a paper on the topic in 1904 in the very same journal which Einstein would publish his plagiarized version in 1905. For his brilliant work in this area, Hasenörhl had received in 1904 a prize from the prestigious Vienna Academy of Sciences.
Furthermore, the mathematical relationship of mass an€nergy was a simple deduction from the already well-known equations of Scottish physicist James Maxwell. Scientists long understood that the mathematic€ationship expressed by the equation E=mc^2 was the logical result of Maxwell's work, they just did not believe it. Thus, the experiments of Thomson, Kaufmann, and finally, and most importantly, Hasenörhl, confirmed Maxwell's work. It is ludicrous to believe th€ Einstein developed this postulate, particularly in light of the fact that Einstein did not have the laboratory necessary to conduct the appropriate experiments.
In this same plagiarized article of Einstein's, he suggested to the scientific community, "Perhaps it will prove possible to test this theory using bodies whose energy content is variable to a high degree (e.g., salts of radium)." This remark demonstrates how little Einstein understood about science, for this was truly an outlandish remark. By saying this, Einstein showed that he really did not understand basic scientific principles and that he was writing about a topic that he did not understand. In fact, in response to this article, J. Precht remarked that such an experiment "lies beyond the realm of possible experience."
The last subject dealt with in Einstei€1905 papers was the foundat€ of light. Einstein wrote about the photoelectr€fect. The photoelect€effect is the release of electrons from certain metals or semiconductors by the action of light. This area of research is particularly important to the Einstein myth because it was for this topic that he unjustly received his 1922 Nobel Prize.
But again, it is not Einstein, but Wilhelm Wien and Max Planck who deserve the credit. The main point of Einstein's paper, and the point for which he is given credit, is that light is emitted and absorbed in finite packets called quanta. This was the explanation for the ph€ric effect. The phot€ic effect had been explained by Heinrich Hertz in 1888. Hertz and others, including Philipp Lenard, worked on understanding this phenomenon. Lenard was the first to show that the energy of the electrons released in the pho€ric effect was not governed by the intensity of the light but by the frequency of the light. This was an important breakthrough.
Wien and Planck were colleagues and they were the fathers of modern day quantum theory. By 1900, Max Planck, based upon his and Wien's work, had shown that radiated energy was absorbed and emitted in finite units called quanta. The only difference in his work of 1900 and Einstein's work of 1905 was that Einstein limited himself to talking about one particular type of energy - light energy. But the principles and equations governing the process in general had been deduced by Planck in 1900. Einstein himself admitted that the obvious con€lusion of Planck's work was that light also existed in discrete p€ of energy. Thus, nothing in this paper of Einstein's was original.
After the 1905 papers of Einstein were published, the scie€ community took little notice and Einstein continued his job at the pate€until 1909 when it was arranged for him to take a position at a school by World Jewry. Still, it was not until a 1919 newspaper headline that he gained any notoriety.
With Einstein's academic appointment in 1909, he was placed in a position where he could begin to use other people's work as his own more openly. He engaged many of his students to look for ways to prove the theories he had supposedly developed, or ways to apply those theories, and then he could present the research as his own or at least take partial credit. In this vein, in 1912, he began to try and express his gravitational research in terms of a new, recently developed calculus, which was conducive to understanding relativity. This was the beginning of his General Theory of €lativity, which he would publish in 1915. But the mathematical work was not done by Einstein - he was incapable of it. Instead, it was performed by the mathematician Marcel Grossmann, who in turn used the mathematical principles developed by Berhard Riemann, who was€first to develop a sound non-Euclidean geometry, which is the basis of all mathematics used to describe relativity.
The Genera€Relativity applied the principles of relativity to the universe; that is, to the gravitational pull of planets and their orbits, and the general principle that light rays bend as they pass by a massive object. Einstein published an initial paper in 1913 based upon the work which Grossmann did, adapting the math of Riemann to Relativity. But this paper was filled with errors and the conclusions were incorrect. It appears that Grossmann was not smart enough to figure it out for Einstein. So Einstein was forced to look elsewhere to plagiarize his General Theory. Einstein€published his correct General Th€elativity in 1915, and said prior to its publication that he, "...completely succeeded in convincing Hilbert and Klein." He is referring to David Hilbert, perhaps the most brilliant mathematician of the 20th century, and Felix Klein, another mathematician who had been instrumental in the develo€nt of the area of calculus that Grossmann had used to develop the Genera€elativity for Einstein.
Einstein's statement regarding the two men would lead the reader to believe that€stein had changed Hilbert's and Klein's opinions regarding General Relativity, and that he had influenced them in their thinking. However, the exact opposite is true. Einstein stole the majority of his Genera€elativity work from these two men, the rest being taken from Grossmann. Hilbert submitted for publication, a week before Einstein completed his work, a paper which contained the correct field equations of General Relativity. What this means is that Hilbert wrote basically the exact same paper, with the same conclusions, before Einstein did. Einstein would have had an opportunity to know of Hilbert's work all along, because there were Jewish friends of his working for Hilbert. Yet, even this was not necessary, for Einstein had seen Hilbert's paper in advance of publishing his own. Both of these papers were, before being printed, delivered in the form of a lecture.
Einstein presented his paper on November 25, 1915 in Berlin and Hilbert had presented his€November 20 in Göttingen. On November 18, Hilbert received a letter from Einstein thanking him for sending him a draft of the treatise Hilbert was to deliver on the 20th. So, in fact, Hilbert had sent a copy of his work at least two weeks in advance to Einstein before either of the two men delivered their lectures, but Einstein did not send Hilbert an advance copy of his. Therefore, this serves as incontrovertible proof that Einstein quickly plagiarized the work and then presented it, hoping to beat Hilbert to the punch. Also, at the same time, Einstein publicly began to belittle Hilbert, even though in the previous summer he had praised him in an effort to get Hilbert to share his work with him. Hilbert made the mistake of sending Einstein this draft copy, but still he delivered his work first.
Not only did Hilbert publish his work first, but it was of much higher quality than Einstein's. It is known today that there are many problems with assumptions made in Einstein's General Theory paper. We know today that Hilbert was much closer to the truth. Hilbert's paper is the forerunner of the uni€ied field theory of €ation and electromagnetism and of the work of Erwin Schrödinger, whose work is the basis of all modern day quantum mechanics.
That the group of men discussed so far were the actual originators of the ideas claimed by Einstein was known by the scientific community all along. In 1940, a group of German physicists meeting in Austria declared that "before Einstein, Aryan scientists like Lorentz, Hasenöhrl, Poincaré, etc., had created the foundations of the theory of €elativity..."
However, the Jewish media did not promote the work of these men. The Jewish me€e work of David Hilbert, but instead they promoted the work of the Jew Albert Einstein. As we mentioned earlier, this General Theory, as postulated by Hilbert first and in plagiarized form by Einstein second, stated that light rays should bend when they pass by€e object. In 1919, during the eclipse of the Sun, light from distant stars passing cl€se to the Sun was observed to bend according to the theory. This evidence supported the General Th€lativity, and the Jewish-controlled media immediately seized upon the opportunity to prop up Einstein as a hero, at the expense of the true genius, David Hilbert.
On November 7th, 1919, the London Times ran an article, the headline of which proclaimed, "Revolution in science - New theory of the Universe - Newtonian ideas overthrown." This was the be€inning of the force-feeding of the Einstein myth to the masses. In the following years, Einstein's earlier 1905 papers were propagandized and Einstein was heralded as the originator of all the ideas he had stolen. Because of this push by the Jewish media, in 1922, Einstein received the Nobel Prize for the work he had stolen in 1905 regarding the photoelect€fect.
The establishm€nt of the Einstein farce between 1919 and 1922 was an important coup for world Zionism and Jewry. As soon as Einstein had been established as an idol to the popular masses of England and America, his image was promoted as the rare genius that he is erroneously believed to be today. As such, he immediately began his work as a tool for World Zionism. The masses bought into the idea that if someone was so brilliant as to change our fundamental understand€ng of the universe, then certainly we ought to listen to his opinions regarding political €nd social issues. This is exactly what World Jewry wanted to establish in its ongoing effort of social engineering. They certainly did not want someone like David Hilbert to be recognized as rare genius. After all, this physicist had come from a strong German, Christian background. His grandfather's two middle names were 'Fürchtegott Leberecht' or 'Fear God, Live Right.' In August of 1934, the day before a vote was to be taken regarding installing Adolf Hitler as President of the Reich, Hilbert signed a proclamation in support of Adolf Hitler, along with other leading German scientists, that was published in the German newspapers. So the Jews certainly€ not want David Hilbert receiving the credit he deserved.
The Jews did not want Max Planck receiving €e deserved either. This German's grandfather and great-grandfather had been important German theologians, and during World War II he would stay in Germany throughout the war, supporting his fatherland the best he could.
The Jews certainly € not want the up-and-coming Erwin Schrödinger to be heralded as a genius to the masses. This Austrian physicist would go on to teach at Adolf Hitler University in Austria, and he wrote a public letter expressing his support for the Third Reich. This Austrian's work on the unified fi€ld theory was a forerunner of modern physics, even though it had been criticized by Einstein, who apparently could not €nderstand it.
The Jews d€ not want to have Werner Heisenberg promoted as a rare genius, even though he would go on to solidify quantum theory and contribute to it greatly, as well as develop his famous uncertainty principle, in addition to describing the modern atom and nucleus and the binding energies that are essential to modern chemistry. No, the Jews did not want Heisenberg€oted as a genius because he would go on to head the German atomic bomb project and serve prison time after the war for his involvement with the Third Reich.
No, the Jews€ not want to give credit to any of a number of white Germans, Austrians, Irishmen, Frenchmen, Scotsmen, Englishmen, and even Americans who had contributed to the body of knowledge and evidence from which Einstein plagiarized and stole his work. Instead, they needed to erect Einstein as their golden calf, even though he repeatedly and often embarrassed himself with his nonfactual or nearsighted comments regarding the work he had supposedly done. For example, in 1934, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran a front page article in which Einstein gave an "emphatic denial" regarding the idea of practical applications for the "energy of the atom." The article says,
"But the 'energy of the atom' is something else again. If you believe that man will someday be able to harness this boundless energy-to drive a great steamship across the ocean on a pint of water, for instance-then, according to Einstein, you are wrong..."
Again, Einstein clearly did not understand the branch of physics he had supposedly founded, though elsewhere in the world at the time theoretical research was underway that would lead to the atomic bomb and nuclear energy. But after Einstein was promoted as a god in 1919, he made no real attempts to plagiarize any other work. Rather, he began his real purpose - evangelizing for the cause of Zionism and World Jewry. Though he did publish other articles after this time, all of them were co-authored by at least one other person, and in each instance, Einstein had little if anything to do with the research that led to the articles; he was merely recruited by the co-authors in order to lend credence to their work. Thus freed of the pretense of academia, Einstein began his assault for World Zionism.
In 1921, Einstein made his first visit to the United States on a fund-raisi€ tour for the Hebrew€ Jerusalem and to promote Zionism. In April of 1922, Einstein used his status to gain membership in a Commission of the League of Nations. In February of 1923, Einstein visits Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. In June of 1923, he becomes a founding member of the Association of Friends of the New Russia. In 1926, Einstein took a break from his Communist and Zionistic activities to again embarrass himself scientifically by criticizing the work of Schrödinger and Heisenberg. Following a brief illness, he resumes his Zionistic agenda, wanting an independent Israel and at the same time a World Government.
In the 1930s he actively campaigns against all forms of war, although he would reverse this position during World War II when he advocated war against Germany and the creation of the atomic bomb, which he thought was impossible to build. In 1939 and 1940, Einstein, at the request of other Jews, wrote two letters to Roosevelt urging an American program to develop an atomic bomb to be used on Germany - not Japan. Einstein€ould have no part in the actual construction of the bomb, theoretical or practical, because he lacked the skills for either.
In December of 1946, Einstein rekindles his efforts for a World Government, with Israel apparently being the only autonomous nation. This push continues through the rest of the 1940s. In 1952, Einstein, who had been i€al in the creation o€ of Israel, both politically and economically, is offered the presidency of Israel. He declines. In 1953, he spends his time attacking the McCarthy Committee, and he supports Communists such as J. Robert Oppenheimer. He encourages civil disobedience in response to the McCarthy trials. Finally, on April 18, 1955, this filthy Jewish demagogue dies.
Dead, the Jews no longer had to worry about Einstein making stupid statements. His death was just the beginn€ng of his usage and exploitation by World Jewry. The Jewish-c€led media continued to promote the myth of this Super-Jew long after his death, and as more and more of the men who knew better died off, the Jews were more and more able to aggrandize his myth and lie more boldly. This brazen lying has culminated in the Jew controlled Time magazine naming Einstein "The Person of t€ Century" at the close of 1999. It may be demonstrated that the Jewish lies have become more bold with the passage of time because Einstein was never named "Man of the Year" while he was alive, but now, over forty years after his death, he is named "Person of€he Century."
Einstein was given this title in spite of the clear-cut choice for the "Person of €he Century," Adolf Hitler. Hitler was indeed named "Man of €le he was still living by Time magazine, and according to a December 27, 1999, article in the USA Today, Einstein was chosen over Adolf Hitler because of the perceived "nasty public relations fallout" that would accompany that choice; yet in internet polling by Time, Hitler finished third and was the top serious candidate. Still the issue of Time magazine dedicated to Einstein, which has articles by men with names like Isaacson, Golden, Stein, Rudenstine, and Rosenblatt, is interesting to read. For one, they found it necessary to include an article rationalizing why they did not pick the obvious choice, Adolf Hitler. But more interesting is the article by Stephen Hawking which purports to be a history of the theory of re€ivity. In it, Hawking admits many of the things in this article, such as the fact that Hilbert published the Gen€Relativity before Einstein and that FitzGerald and Lorentz deduced the concept of relativity long before Einstein. Hawking also writes,
"Einstein...was deeply disturbed by the work of Werner Heisenberg in Copenhagen, Paul Dirac in Cambridge and Erwin Schrödinger in Zurich, who developed a new picture of reality called quantum mechanics. ... Einstein was horrified by this ... Most scientists, however, accepted the validity of the new quantum laws because they showed excellent agreement with observations ... They are the basis of modern developments in chemistry, molecular biology and electronics and the founda€on of the technology that has transformed the world in the past half-century."
This is all very true, yet the same magazine credits Einstein with all of the modern developments that Hawking names, even through Einstein was so stupid as to be vehemently against the most important idea of modern science, just as he opposed Schrödinger's work in unified field theory which was far ahead of its time. The same magazine admits that "success eluded" Einstein in the field of explaining the contradictions between relativity and quantum mechanics. Today, these contradictions are explained by the unified fi€d theory, but Einstein, who proves himself to be one of the least intelligent of 20th century scientists, refused to believe in either quantum theory or the unified field theory.
To name Einstein as "The Person€ Century" is one of the most ludicrous and absurd lies of all time, yet it has been successfully pulled off by Isaacson, Go€Rosenblatt and the Jewish owners of Time magazine. If the Jews at Time wanted to give the title to an inventor or scientist, then the most obvious choice would have been men like Hilbert, Planck, or Heisenberg. If they wanted to give it to the scientist who most fundamentally changed the landscape of 20th century science, then the obvious ch€ice would be William Shockley. This Nobel prize winning scientist invented the transistor, which is€s of all modern electronic devices and computers, everything from modern cars and telephones, VCRs and watches, to the amazing computers which have allowed incomprehensible advances in all fields of science. Without the transistor, all forms of science today would be basically in the same place that they were in the late 1940s.
However, the Jews cannot allow the due credit to go to William Shockley because he spent the majority of his scientific career demonstrating the genetic and mental inferiority of non-whites and arguing for their sterilization. His scientific, genetic views led the Jews to financially destroy Shockley who founded the first company in the Silicon Valley, his hometown, to develop computer chips. The Jews hired away his entire staff and used them to start Fairchild semiconductor, the company that today is known as Intel.
No the Jews could not let any of the truly great geniuses of our time be recognized, not the anti-Semite Henry Ford, not the great German sci€tists who helped the National Socialists in Germany, not Charles Lindbergh, who was sympathetic to National Socialist causes, and certainly not William Shockley, one of t€ brilliant physicists and geneticists of our time. Instead, the Jews propped up the Zionist, Communist Albert Einstein who hated everything white.
After Wor€ Einstein demonstrated his hatred of the White Race and of the Germans in particular in the following statements. He was asked what he thought about Germany and about re-educating the Germans after the war and said,
"The nation has been on the decline mentally and morally since 1870...Behind the Nazi party stands the German people, who elected Hitler after he had in his book and in his speeches made his shameful intentions clear beyond the possibility of misunderstanding. ... The Germans can be killed or constrained after the war, but they cannot be re-educated to a democratic way of thinking and acting..."
Einstein here is advocating the murder of Germans, because he feels that this is the only way that they can be kept in check. He is right about one thing, the Germans did knowingly support the cause of National Socialism, but what Einstein is attacking is Christianity, because it was Christianity that led the German people to overwhelmingly support National Socialism. It was the German Christian Faith Movement and the Christian Social Party of men like Karl Lueger that led the €people to their understanding of Jews. The Jew Daniel Goldhagen has recently shown the Christian basis of National Socialism in his book, Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust, and the book Why The Jews? by Prager and Telushkin similarly proves the Christian origins of what the Jews call 'anti-Semitism.' Einstein €nderstood this and Einstein, like all Jews, hated Christianity. So what Einstein was really advocating was the killing and constraining of all true Christians, not just German Christians. This is the true purpose and intent of Zionism and the demagogue Einstein was merely a tool of World Zionism and Jewry towards this end.
Zionistic Jews understand that true, primitive Christianity is the mortal enemy of mongrel Judaism. This is why the Jews, like Einstein, hated Nazi Germany so much, for National S€ist Germany advocated primitive, positive Christianity in the 24th point of its Party Platform.

After Brit€ung Alberto before the Arnesteiniums moved from [[Mars]] to [[Afrika]].]]
Alberto Reis Arnesteinium, Albert Einstien's real name, was born on December 31, 2001.  He is commonly mistaken for [[Alberti InStein]], who was born in the Great War of 1812.  Alberti was a naval officer of the Zulu tribe in Afrika, and he fought both the Americans and the British in that war.  Alberto was a famous scientist who's name is synonomous with the words genius and intelligence.  For example, "Adolf was a real Einstein", and other similar context.  He is only five years old when he developed the theory o€eneral reletivity and the grand unifying theory uniting all the forces.  He has disproved string theory and instead came up with the M-2 theory, the [[Matrix-2]] theory.  In this grand unifying theory, everyone lives within their own thought plane.  Everything is just a plane of thought.  In his theory, there are 5.5 trillion dimensions, compared with the 12 in string theory.  His theory is no longer a theory because they have PROVED it.  He has completed a doctorates degree in all forms of scientific study and was educated at Harvard and Yale.  How this happened remains to be seen.  However, he died March 1, 2006 of 56 different forms of cancers obtained from developing highly dangerous chemicals in the school gymnasium.  He was diagnosed with cancers not known to the human race until now.  As a result, everyone in Harvard and Yale has cancer.  He was buried with full military rites in Afrika. He is succeeded with two children and his fifteen wives.

such legends are unfounded.

a change in the numbering-system used to record grades may have caused confusion among non-experts years later.

In 1902 Einstien had a dream he was bing chased by black midgets who tried to eat his mothers cranberries. The midgets were Moe Chirs and Craig therefore MC squared. The night before he was told that Elderberries taste like rainber sherbert straightr from the leprachauns behind. thats where the E came from. After having this dream he invented the flux cupassitor which enabled him to go back in time and eat the rainbow sherbert straight from the lepraxhauns behind because its better that wa. He soon found out that in 1641 that leprachauns were too ugly to eat from so he had to settle for the creamsicle sherbert from the unicorns behind.  This unicorn feces tasted incredible . He couldn;t believe what he came upon. He was going to go back and tell the world but someone through a spare testicle from a three baller and it hit thim right in the gwigglesposher. This put him into a coma for 62 years straight and when he woke up he kept saying E=MCsquared over and over again. Brock Lee a man from the time that he was in took Einsteins idea and told it to his kids so they could grow up  and invent bombs. HE named his kid Albert Ei€stein and that Albert Einstien is the one who invented bombs and is wanted in 36 countries. To this day people think he is alive becuase he invented a solution consisting of unicorn feces a beard form an irish goblin and the neck of the fattest kid he knew (his name was Phil) this concoction gave him eternal life and he is believed to live somewhere in the mideast under the name Chris parker but his friends call him osama been lame man.

Although Albert showed great intellectual abilities, particularly in the areas of mathematics and the sciences, he struggled throughout his school career.  While such things were not addressed at that time, based on symptomology it has been hypothesiz€d that he suffered from a Learning Disability in addition to his obvious Giftedness.  As a result, he often saw things differently than other people.  He failed fourth grade mathematics because, while he could "see" the correct answer, he did not "show his work" as required by the teacher.  He never did learn to tie his shoes.

In this respect, Einstein had more in common with "classical" physicists. He rejected the idea of the universe being fundamentally probabilistic, and believed that the Universe was mechanistic and deterministic - his ongoing arguments with [[Quantum_mechanics%2C_philosophy_and_controversy| Heisenberg and Bohr]] are testament to this. Although comfortable with probability, his reasoning was that underlying these phenomena was an essentially deterministic solution.

===Thoughts on Science and Religion===
Einstein compared his views with those of traditional science and religion.
By way of background, it's important to remember that,
although he famously challenged the theories behind quantum mechanics,
he accepted it's empirical predictions.
In fact, his Nobel Prize winning paper on the Photoelectric Effect
provided the scientific€ommunity the first definitive proof that quanta existed.
But, just as a dice toss is known to be [[pseudorandom]] (i.e. [[causal]])
even when €he outcome,
Einstein asserted that all randomness must be pseudorandom
so that [[block ti€ctional]]

===Personal relations===
Letters written by Einstein to his relatives and kept at the Hebrew Uni€erusalem, have revealed that during the course of his life, he had a dozen lovers, two of whom he married.
Barbara Wolff of the Hebrew€University's Albert Ein€in Archives has made public about 3,500 pages of correspondence including letters to his first and second wives and children between the years 1912-1955.
In letters to his second wife Elsa and her daughter Margot he disclosed that he had been showered with unwanted attention from women.

He adored his stepdaughter and in a letter to Elsa in 1924, he writes: "I love her [Margot] as much as if she were my own daughter, perhaps even more so, since who knows what kind of brat she would have become [had I fathered her].''

While at Prague, Einstein published a paper calling on astronomers to test two predictions of his developing theory of relativity: a bending of light in a gravitational field, measurable at a solar eclipse; and a redshift of solar spectral lines relative to spectral lines produced on Earth's surface. A young German astronomer, Erwin Freundlich, began collaborating with Einstein and alerted other astronomers around the world about Einstein's astronomical tests.<ref>[Crelinsten, Jeffrey, Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity, Princeton €ty Press, 2006]</ref> In 1912, Einstein returned to [[Zurich€rossmann]], who introduced him to Riemannian geometry.

Einstein's published papers on general relativity were not available outside of Germany due to the war. News of Einstein's new theory reached English-speaking astronomers in England and America via Dutch physicists Hendrik Antoo€rentz and Paul Ehrenfest and their colleague Willem de Sitter, Director of Leiden Observatory. Arthur Stan€ Eddington in England, who was Secretary of the Royal €al Society, asked de Sitter to write a series of articles in English for the benefit of astronomers. He was fascinated with the new theory and became a leading proponent and popularizer of relativity.<ref> Crelinsten, Einstein's Jury, pp. 94-98 </ref> Most astronomers did not like Einstein's geometrization of gravity and believed that his light bending and gravitational redshift predictions would not be correct.

In 1909 Ei€presented a paper ('''Über d€diation]]) to a gath€hysicists on the history of [[luminife€us aether|aether theories]] and, more importantly, on the quanti€n of light.  In this and an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that the ''energy'' quanta introduced by [[Max Planck]] also carried a well-defined ''momentum'' and acted in many respects as if they were independent, point-like particles.  More importantly, he showed that light must be ''simultaneously'' a wave and a particle, and foretold correctly that physics stood on the brink of a revolution that would require them to unite these [[wave-par€le duality|dual natures]] of light.  However, his own proposal for a solution -- that [[James Maxwell|Maxwell's]] equations €omagnetic fields be modified to allow wave solutions that are bound to singularities of the field -- was never developed, although it may have influenced [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie's]] [[pilot wave]] hypothesis for [[quantum me€hanics]].

In this paper, Einstein extends [[Max Planck|Planck's]] hypothesis that electromagn€tic energy is absorbed or emitted by matter in quanta of <math>h \nu</math> (where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\nu</math> is the frequency o€ the light), proposing a new law
:<math>
E_{\mathrm{max}}  = h\nu - P
</math>
to account for the [[phot€ffect]], as well as other properties of [[photoluminescence]] and [[photoionization]].  In later papers, Einstein used this law to describe the [[Volta effect]] (1906), the production of secondary [[cathode ray]]s (1909) and the high-frequency limit of [[Bremsstrahlung]] (1911).  Einstein's key contribution is his assertion that energy quantization is an general, intrinsic property of [[light]], rather than a particular constraint imposed by the interaction between matter and light, as [[Max Planck|Planck]] believed.  Another, often overlooked result of this paper was Einstein's excellent estimate (6.17 <math>\times</math> 10<sup>23</sup>) of [[Avogadro€ number]] (6.02 <math>\tim€>23</sup>).  However€ Einstein does ''not'' propose that light is a particle in this paper; the "photon" concept was not proposed until 1909 (see below).
His second €ation is a general, €onstraint of the interaction € of the interaction €rticles.

{{sprotected}€ Einstein objected to the [[Copenhagen€ equations. The vast majority see the reason for his objection in terms of the view that he was a rigid determinist (see [[scientific€stically]]). They would cite a 1926 lette€tein made the remark which history recalls the most:
''Quantum me€erence]]s. Another important part of Einstein's viewpoint is the famous 1935 paper ''Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?'' written by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.
Most physicists see this as presenting an assumption of determinism.
We might note here that Wolfgang Pauli and John S. Bell contradicted this view of Einstein. Here is Bell: (<ref> ref needed </ref>)
"There is a widespread and erroneous conviction that for Einstein determinism
was always the sacred principle. The quotability of his famous
`God does n€ play dice' has not helped in this respect. Among those who had great
difficulty seeing Einstein's position was Born. Pauli tried to help
in a letter of 1954:
'...I was unable to recognize Einstein whenever you talked about him in either
your letter or your manuscript. It seemed to me as if you had erected some
dummy Einstein for yourself, which you then knocked down with great pomp.
In particular Einstein does not consider the concept of `determinism' to
be as fundamental as it is frequently held to be (as he told me emphatically
many times) ... he disputes  that he uses as a criterion for the
admissibility of a theory the question "Is it rigorously deterministic?"...
he was not at all annoyed with you, but only said that you were a person
who will not listen'...
...These references to Born are not meant to diminish one of the towering
figures of modern physics. They are meant to illustrate the difficulty
of putting aside preconceptions and listening to what is actually being
said. They are meant to encourage you,  dear listener, to listen
a little harder'' Bell says this (<ref>reference needed</ref>) of the Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen paper: ''It is important to note that to the limited degree to which determinism plays a role in the EPR argument, it is not assumed but inferred.''
Both camps would agree that Einstein never rejected probabilistic techniques and thinking in and of themselves. Einstein h€emble]]s. According to the majority o€physicists, however, he believed that indeterminism constituted a criteria for strong objection to a physical theory. Pauli and Bell found a different Einstein.
More recent times have given us another twist to this business. The same John Stewart Bell has discovered further interesting results ([[Bell's Theo€equality]]) in his researches on the Einstein, € and Rosen paper. Again there is a divergence in thinking as to the conclusions derivable from this. Bell himself stated that quantum nonlocality had been established, while others saw the death of determinism.
Whatever his inner convictions, Einstein a€ that the quantum theory was the best a€ gravity.

To this, €and Rosen. Most phys€tle harder" Bell says t€en paper: "It is important € inferred."
Both camps €tle harder."
Bell says th€n S. Bell disagreed with the assertion that Einstein's objection could be seen as insistence on determinism. Bell - who was of a more recent generation, and did not know Einstein personally - points out that the above 'God does € play dice' quotation was something stated quite early, and Einstein's later statements were concerned with other issues. In the 1935 Einstein, €osen paper, Einstein focusses on the 'incompleteness' of quantum mechanics. Bell: (<ref>reference €ded</ref>): "It is i€inferred." In the the 1949 ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher and Scientist'' (<ref> ref €ed </ref>) we again find Einstein speaking of incompleteness as the diagnosis of quantum's ills.
Here is Bell (<ref> re€d </ref>) giving a Wolgang Pauli quotation on the matter: "There is a wi€harder."

STUPI DIn 1894, fo€nd Rosen. Some physicists see this paper as supporting the case for seeing the man as a determinist.
We might€eterminist.
We might€d in EPR.
Here is Jo€ll on the issue: "There i€eterminism was alway€e harder."
Einstein €atements, contradict such a picture.
M€ from this in conjunction with the EPR analysis. Bell him€ paper as further supporting t€t Einstein was a determinist€han this. There is a case to be made for a different view of Einstein's objections to quantum orthodoxy. Einstein himself made furth€ng Pauli. The above €ng Pauli. The above €stics====
In 1924, E€ality = [[United Sta€American]], [[Swiss]€American]], [[Swiss]€hanics]].
Beginning in the mid-19€ Einstein voiced his objections to the [[Copenhagen€quations. His opposition in this regard would continue all his life. The majority see the re€935 paper <ref> A. Einstein, B. Podolsky, and N. Rosen, ''Phys. Rev.'' '''47''', 777 (1935) </ref> written by€ see this work as further su€nist.
We must note here €ade for a quite different €yond that just given, and an emphatic comment on the matter was made by his contemporary Wolfgang P€ the 1935 "EPR" paper - entitled "Can Quantu€l Reality Be Considered Complete?" - Einstein concludes this way: "While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the questio€f whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible."
The Wolfgang Pauli quotation is as follows <ref> M. Born (editor), ''The Born-Einstein-Letters'', p. 221 (Macmillan, London (1971)). </ref> <br />
: "...I was unab€about him <br />
: in either €f you had <br />
: erected so€cked down <br />
: with great€e concept <br />
: of `determ€eld to be <br />
: (as he tol€s) ... he ''disputes'' that he uses as <br />
: a criterio€on "Is it <br />
: rigorously€ you, but <br />
: only said t€not listen." <br />
In 1949 (<ref> P.A. Schilpp, Ed. ''Albert Einstein, Philosopher-Scientist'', Tudor, N.Y. (1949). </ref>), Einstein sets up a fascinating experimental proposal somewhat similar to Schroedinger's cat: <br />
: "Rather than considering a system which comprises only a radioactive atom <br />
: (and its process of transformation), one considers a system which includes <br />
: also the means for ascertaining the radioactive transformation--for example, a <br />
: Geiger-counter with automatic registration mechanism. Let this include a <br />
: registration-strip, moved by a clockwork, upon which a mark is made by <br />
: tripping the counter. True, from the point of view of quantum€mechanics <br />
: this total system is very complex and its configuration space is of <br />
: very high dimension. But there is in principle no objection to treating <br />
: this entire system from the standpoint of quantum me€ics. Here too the <br />
: theory determines the probability of each configuration of all coordinates <br />
: for every time instant. If one considers all configurations of the coordinates,<br />
:  for a time large compared with the average decay time of the radioactive <br />
: atom, there will be (at most) one such registration-mark on the paper <br />
: strip. To each co-ordinate- configuration must correspond a definite position <br />
: of the mark on the paper strip. But, inasmuch as the theory yields only the relative 
 : probability of the thinkable coordinate-configurations, it also offers only <br />
: relative probabilities for the positions of the mark o€ the paperstrip, but <br />
: no definite location for this mark." <br />

=====Incompleteness and Realism=====
Many of Einstein's comments indicate his belief that quantum mechanics is 'incomplete'. This was first asserted in the famous 1935 Einst€ky, Rosen ("EPR") paper <ref> €Podolsky, N. Rosen, €' '''47''' 777 (1935) </ref>, and it appears again in the 1949 book  ''Albert E€cientist'' <ref> P.A. Schil€9). </ref>.
The "EPR" pape€plete?" - has Einstein concluding: "While we h€ossible."
In the Schilpp book <ref> p. 671 </ref>, Einstein s€,<br />
: for a time€
Einstein continues: <br />
: "...If we attempt [to work with] the interpretation that the quantum-theoretical <br />
: description is to be understood as a complete desc€on of the individual system, <br />
: we are forced to the interp€ that the location of the mark on the strip is <br />
: nothing which belongs to the system ''per se'', but that the existence of that <br />
: location is essentially dependent upon the carrying out of an observation made on <br />
: the registration-strip. Such an interpretation is certainly by no means absurd <br />
: from a purely logical point of standpoint; yet there is hardly anyone who would <br />
: be inclined to consider it seriously. For, in the macroscopic sphere it simply <br />
: is considered certain that one must adhere to the program of a realistic description <br /> : in space and time; whereas in the sphere is microscopic situations, one is more <br />
: readily inclined to give up, or at least to modify, this program."<br />
: (€is due to Einstein)
Einstein € testimony contradicts this, and Einstein'€tatements indicate a focus on incompleteness, as his major concern.

==Biograph€[[1879]], around 11:30 AM [[Local mean time|LMT]], in the€of [[Ulm]] in [[Würt€of [[Ulm]] in [[Würt€y===
In the "Copenhagen Interpretation" section (1.3.2) above, reference was made to the disagreement regarding €instein's actual position regarding the quantum theory. The famous quotation '''God does not€play dice''' is often used to support the majority view that he disliked the theory due to its indeterminism.
Others make the case for a different view. They note that subsequent to the 1926 "Dice" quotation, one would be hard pressed to find anything similar from the man, but instead one sees his focus on the conceptually independent suject of 'incompleteness'. This focus is shown both in his 1935 "EPR" paper, and in his 1949 geiger counter registration strip thought-experiment (see section 1.3.2.2). Further evidence against the "Einstein-determinist" view is W. Pauli's quotation: "he (Einstein) '''disputes''' that he € question 'Is it rigoro€rministic?'".
Now we come to the general question of Albert Einstein's philosophy of science. Here are a few quotations which may be revealing. First, regarding the relation of religion to the scientist:
<blockquote>
<p>
You will hardl€aive man.
<p>
For the la€with awe.
<p>
But the sc€flection.
</blockquote>
<ref>{{ ci€ }}</ref>
Also:

Finally, his devotion to Schopenhauer can be cited:

'''Quotations on Religion'''
:''I c€n Religion'''
:''I c€g. First, we have the same passage given above in the religious views section above. The third paragraph taken from ''The Worl€I See It'' quotation runs:

Instead one sees €n. Instead Einstein focussed on the conceptually €ss'. This attention is shown b€pendent subject of 'incomplet€tion occurred when t€tion occurred when t€tein focused on the €tein focused on the € }}</ref>
Perhaps its good to end with the following general assessment, as given by his colleague Nathan Rosen:
<blockquote>
''I think that the things which impressed me most were the simplicity of his thinking and his faith in the ability of the human mind to understand the workings of nature. Throughout his life, Einstein believed the human reason was capable of leading to theories that would provide correct descriptions of physical phenomena. In building a theory, his approach had something in common with that of an artist; he would aim for simplicity and beauty (and beauty for him was, after all, essentially simplicity). The crucial question that he would ask, when weighing an element of a theory was: "Is it reasonable?" No matter how successful a theory appeared to be, if it seemed to him not to be reasonable (the German word that he used was "''vernunftig''"), he was convinced that the theory could not provide a really fundamenta€anding of nature

The Strange and Wonderful Odyssey of Albert Einstein
Albert looked around him in confusion and dismay. A few moments earlier it had been a pleasant Spring afternoon, and the professor had been sitting in his warm, comfortable study, his trademark shock of wild hair standing on end as he puffed away contentendly at his pipe and sifted through the various papers that lay before him on his desk. Now, suddenly and inexplicably, he found himself stranded in a frightening and unfamiliar landscape, with large, half-melted clocks dangling from the branches of trees, numbers, including the earth-shattering equation whose essence he himself had discovered, and what looked like a weird, dark-haired little girl, whose back was now turned to him, and who seemed to be sitting in a pool of light not but a few feet away. Could it be that, while unconsciously pondering his "theory of €elativity", as he always did on those infrequent occasions when he had little else to occupy his attention, the intensity of the esteemed Dr.'s thoughts had somehow propelled him through a time-warp leading to an alternate dimension?

At his birth, Albert's mother was reputedly frightened that her infant's head was so large and oddly shaped. Though the size of his head appeared to be less remarkable as he grew older, it's evident from photographs of Einstein that his head was proportionately large for his body throughout his life, a trait regarded as "benign [[macrocephaly]]" in large-headed individuals with no related disease or cognitive deficits.
Another more famous aspect of Einstein's€childhood is the fact that he spoke much later than the average child. Einstein c€imed that he did not begin speaking until the age of three, though it's never been clear whether by "speaking", Einstein meant uttering a first word, speaking in phrases or conversationally. Because of Einstein's late speech development and his later childhood tendency to ignore any subject in school that bored him- instead focusing intensely only on what interested him- some observers at the time suggested that he might be "retarded". This latter observation was not the only time in his life that controversial labels and [[pathology]] would be applied to Einstein. (See 4.2 of this article, "Speculation€ontroversy".)

Although Einstein had a wealth of knowledge in the field of Science and most famously, relativity, for which he created the equation E=MC*C, since hisdeath research has found that this equation may have been based on a similar equation formed by Dr Laurence Hurrell in 1912. His theory was based on the launch of the Titanic, and the British scientist worked out that for an adequate ammount of energy needed to power the Titanic, it must be related to the weight of the ship. This was obvious but his thoery like einstiens "origional equation" entertained the prospect of how light travelled. Although his work was basic and pretty incomprehensible even to him, Einstein w€ a known admirer of his work (despite being english) and will have read most of his published papers. Although all credit must go to Einstein, Hurrell was obviously an earlier genious and his work on the theory of "reletivity" although basic, should be given credit.
Studies on Hurrell's behaviour socially shows that he may have had a higher IQ and therefore greater brain capacity than Einstein himself.

As for Einstein's delayed speech development, a few have specu€ sentences.

"[[The Einstein Syndrome]]" was even co€ Sowell]] (with the research support Professor [[Steven Pinker]] and others in the field of speech development) to describe t€phenomenon, which effects a small percentage of late-talking children who go on to develop into socially normal and analytically advanced adults.

It's more l€kely that Einstein was displaying a €binson]], pianists [€d Teller]], among others. A [[syndrome]] - the Einstein syndrome- was even coine€phenomenon, which is believed to effect a small per€ed adults. The autopsy performed after Einst€in's death uncovered anomalies in brain development which potentially support the theory that the analytical functions of his brain may have hyper-developed prenatally, perhaps temporarily "robbing" resources away from the area of the brain responsible for speech development. In support of coining a syndrome after Einstein, there are currently no exact diagnostic matches in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV]] which precisely describe Einstein's speech delay or that of his famous late-talking peers. The closest match may be [[specific language impairment]], though the controversies and speculations on this and other aspects of Einstein's life and character rage on.

Einstein's€childhood development- and the particulars of his behavior in general which do not relate directly to his contributions to theoretical physics- will always be of interest to many because it was these particulars of character which have become syn€mous with the atypical general development and traits of gifted children everywhere, an often misunderstood and misidentified population. Knowledge of Einstein's evolution as a human being could be said to have aided the evolution of gifted education.
When Einstein was asked what he felt children needed most in order to optimally develop, he replied "Freedom". What Einstein specifically meant by "freedom" can be left to speculations by those who would attempt to encapsulate and encompass Einstein's character in terms of pathology and disorders, something which Einstein- were he alive today- may well have wished freedom ''from''.

But at the same time, in answering the queary of what might be best for children's development, Einstein clearly understood that he was looked to as a model of human potential. Another  variously quoted utterance of Einstein's - "Make things as simple as €ble but not simpler" -could argue that, as long as he is a topic of interest, one must take care not to over-simplify him in service to science or scientific agenda. Einstein'€childhood developmen€ny because, in part, it was the€man being has aided the e€ education and could continue to increase an understanding of baffling, irrascible and unconventional behaviors of very special individuals, keeping in mind Einstein's humorous caveat: "We should €ersonality".

On March 14, 1879 in  Ulm, Germany, Albert Ein€was born. He was the son of Herman and Paulina Einstein. Albert was a quiet child, who  liked mathematics. He did not like school. When he was young boy his family moved to Munich, Germany.
When Albert was 5 his parents enrolled him at Volksschule a catholic elem€ary school. Soon after when Albert was 10 he left the Voksschule and went to the Luitpold Gymnasium, in Munich, Germany. In 1895, his family€moved to Milan, Italy. Soon after Albert quit school and moved with them. Albert Einstein graduated from the Federal Ins€Technology in 1900. He began to teach hi school. He then went on tom work at the Swiss Patent Office.
Some  of  Albert Einstein's inventions include: E=MC2 which is energy equals times the velocity of light squared. Hear are what the letters stand for  "E" stands for energy, "M" stands for mass, Finally  "C" stands for the veloci€of light. E=MC2 proves the mean for atomic and nuclear physics. One other invention is the photoelectr€effect. That is the emission of electrons from a metal surface irradiated by ultraviolet rays or other electromag€ radiation. In 1905 Albert Einstein made a very important achievement, it was theory of rel€tivity. The theory o€elativity showed that no object can travel faster than light. He wrote many books about his  inventions.

A '''pie''' is a baked food, with a b€y made of [[pastry]] that cover€illing of [[meat]], [[fish]], [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]], [[cheese]]s, [[cream (food)|creams]], [[chocolate]], [[custard]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, or other s€ingredients. Pies can be e€ known as [[tart]]s or tartlets. An example of a bottom-cru€-only pie that is savoury rather than sweet is a [[quiche]]. [[Tarte Tatin]] is a one-crus€derneath. [[Blind-baking]] is used to de€bite-size [[party pie]]s or small [[tartlet]]s, to sing€s (e.g. a [[pasty]]) and larger€ flaky or [[puff pastry]], a sturdy [[shortcrust pastry]], or, in the c€y pies, a [[hot water crust pastry]].
Occasionall€ the term ''pie'' is used t€unrelated [[confection]]s containing€, such as [[Eskimo pie]] or [[moon pie]].
==Regional variations==
Pies with f€s such as [[pork pie|pork]], [[steak and kidney pie|steak and kidney]], [[minced beef]] and [[onion]], or [[chicken]] and [[mushroom]] are popular in the [[United Kingdom]] as take-awa€native to [[fish and chips]] at British chip shops.  The residents of [[Wigan]] are so renowne€delicacy. [[Shepherd's pie]] is also a favo€st people throughout Britain.
Pies may be ser€ce cream, a style kn€merica as ''[[à la mode]]''.  [[Apple pie]] is a traditional choice, though any pie with swee€be served ''à la mode''.  This pie is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the Uni€ed States.
The [[Australian meat pie]] has an iconic c€to be the [[Australia|Australian]] National Food.  These meat pies contain beef and g€flakey top. The many€ forms of [[takeaway food]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], with one of the m€lia being [[Four'N Twenty Pie]]. Many bake€iarity of [[Adelaide]] cuisine is the [[Pie floater]].
==History==
The pie has be€ of Egypt), the pie is beli€ad to Rome, somewhere arou€00 years.  The first€eat pies.  The crust€ filling.  Sometimes€ handles.  For a lon€hef named [[Guillaume Tirel]] produced a cooker€settlers.  As in Rom€ filling.  Today, vi€ry in the world has some form of pie.
==Pie in popu€ar culture==
Cream fille€ct called [[pieing]]. Activists s€up is the [[Biotic Baking Brigade]]. "Pieing" ca€throwers [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1022042coulter2.html]. In [[Des Moines, Iowa]], in [[1977]], singer and anti-[[gay rights|gay-rights]] activist [[Anita Bryant]] became one of the€ical act.  See [[List of pe€ been pied]].
Pie is regu€ous ends. ''Pie'' itself may be an [[inherently funny word]], or it may be €ituation. The word is also a [[homonym]] with the [[Greek]] letter [[?]], which adds a humourous slant in some mathematics-related instances. In any case, t€numerable [[popular culture|pop culture]] references to pie:
*In the Flash cartoon series [[Weebl and Bob]], the main characters' favourite food is pie. The first episode's title is Pie, and many of the episodes concentrate on their love of pies, even though they almost always fail at obtaining pies.
*In British culture, a €e chant of "[[Who Ate All the Pies?]]"
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s radio show ''[[A Prairie H€ Companion]]'' regularly th€sor named ''[[Beebopareeb€hubarb Pie]]'', which supposedly€ls frozen [[rhubarb pie]]s.
*In the popular American comedy film ''[[American Pie]]'', one character describes the [[vagina]] as feeling like "Warm apple pie." This makes the main character, Jim, played by Jason Biggs, succumb to the temptation of having sex with a pie, and he embarrassingly gets caught in the act.  The use of "pie" as a metaphor for female genitalia is also featured in the song "[[Cherry Pie (song)|Cherry Pie]]", performed by band [[Warrant (band)|Warrant]], and featured on their album of [[Cherry Pie|the same name]].

In the video game ((Red Alert 2)), Einstein is a major character who designs many weapons for the Allied forces, among them the Chronosphere, a Weather Control Device, Prism Tower, as well as the Prism and Mirage Tanks.  He is portrayed in in-game movies by Larry Gelman.  In the games sequel, ((Yuri's Revenge)), Einstein creates a time machine which both Allied and Soviet forces end up using (depending on which the player is controlling), and is also kidnapped by Yuri forces and forced to help with his war effort.  The player is required to rescue him.  In both games, he is the brains behind the brawn of many of the other Allied characters.

{{Redi€ While at [[Prague]], Einstein p€relativity
Einstein fue llevado de marcha la 14 de 1879, alrededor 11:30 est LMT, a una familia judía, en la ciudad de Ulm en Württemberg, Alemania, cerca de 100 kilómetros al este de Stuttgart. Su padre era Hermann Einstein, vendedor que funcionó más adelante trabajos electroquímicos, y su madre era Pauline, née Koch. Fueron casados en Stuttgart-Mal Cannstatt. En su nacimiento, asustaron que la cabeza de su infante era así que grande y fueron formada extrañamente a la madre de Albert reputado. Aunque el tamaño de su cabeza aparecía ser menos tan notable que él creció más viejo, es evidente de las fotografías de Einstein que su cabeza era proporcionalmente grande para su cuerpo a través de su vida, un rasgo mirado como "benigno macrocephaly" en individuos grande-dirigidos sin enfermedad relacionada o déficit cognoscitivo. Otro aspecto más famoso de la niñez de Einstein es el hecho de que él habló mucho más adelante que el niño medio. Einstein demandó que él no comenzó a hablar hasta la edad de tres y no lo hizo solamente tan vacilante, incluso más allá de la edad de nueve (véase 4.2 de este artículo, "especulación y controversia"). Debido a el último desarrollo del discurso de Einstein y su tendencia más última de la niñez de no hacer caso de cualquier tema en la escuela que lo aburrió - en lugar de otro centrándose intenso solamente en que qué interesado lo - algunos observadores sugirió en ese entonces que él puede ser que "sea retardado," por ejemplo una de las amas de casa de la familia de Einstein. Esta última observación no era la última vez en su vida que las etiquetas y la patología polémicas serían aplicadas a Einstein. (véase otra vez, "especul€troversia".) Los miembros eran todos de la familia de Albert judíos no-observadores y él atendió a una escuela primaria católica. En la insistencia de su madre, le dieron lecciones del violín. Aunque él tuvo aversión inicialmente las lecciones, y las continuó eventual, él tomaría más adelante gran consuelo en los sonatas del violín de Mozart. Cuando Einstein era cinco, su padre le demostró un compás pequeño del bolsillo, y Einstein realizó que algo en espacio "vacío" actuaba sobre la aguja; él describiría más adelante la experiencia como uno de los acontecimientos ma's revelatory de su vida. Él construyó modelos y los dispositivos mecánicos para la diversión y demostró gran capacidad matemática temprano encendido. En 1889, un estudiante de medicina nombró a Máximo Talmud (más adelante: Talmey), que visitó el Einsteins el las noches de jueves por seis años, [3 ] Einstein introducido para afinar ciencia y los textos de la filosofía, incluyendo la crítica de Kant de la razón pura. Dos de sus tíos fomentarían más lejos sus intereses intelectuales durante su última niñez y adolescencia temprana recomendando y proporcionando los libros en ciencia, matemáticas y la filosofía. Einstein atendió al gimnasio de Luitpold, donde él recibió una educación relativamente progresiva. Él comenzó a aprender matemáticas alrededor de la edad doce; en 1891, él se enseñó geometría plana euclidiana de un librete de la escuela y comenzó a estudiar cálculo cuatro años más adelante; Einstein realizó la energía del razonamiento deductivo axiomático del libro de los elementos de Euclid, que Einstein llamó la "pequeña geometría santa book"[3 ] (dada por Max Talmud). Mientras que en el gimnasio, Einstein clashed con autoridad y se resentía el régimen de la escuela, creyendo que el alcohol de aprender y el pensamiento creativo fueron perdidos en los esfuerzos tales como la memorización terminante. En 1894, siguiendo la falta del negocio electroquímico de Hermann Einstein, el Einsteins se movió desde Munich a Pavía, una ciudad en Italia cerca de Milano. El primer trabajo científico de Einstein, llamado "la investigación del estado de Aether en campos magnéticos", fue escrito contemporaneously para uno de sus tíos. Albert permanecía detrás en los alojamientos de Munich acabar la escuela, terminando solamente un término antes de dejar el gimnasio en el resorte de 1895 para contestar a su familia en Pavía. Él paró un año y una mitad antes de exámenes finales sin decir a sus padres, convenciendo la escuela lo dejó ir con una nota médica de un doctor amistoso, pero éste significó que él no tenía ninguna secundario-escuela certificate.[4 ] ese año, en la edad de 16, él realizó el experimento del pensamiento conocido como "espejo de Albert Einstein". Después de mirar en un espejo, él examinó qué sucedería a su imagen si él se movía a la velocidad de la luz; su conclusión, de que la velocid€ de la luz es independiente del observador, se convirtió en más adelante uno de los dos postulados de la relatividad especial. Aunque él sobresalió en la pieza de las matemáticas y de la ciencia de las examinaciones de entrada para el instituto polit'ecnico federal en Zurich, hoy el ETH Zurich, su falta de la porción liberal de los artes era un revés; su familia lo envió a Aarau, Suiza a la escuela secundaria del final, y llegó a estar claro que él no iba a ser ingeniero eléctrico como su padre pensó para él. Allí, él estudió la teoría electromágnetica del maxwell raramente-enseñado y recibió su diploma en septiembre de 1896. Durante este tiempo, él se alojó con la familia de profesor Jost Winteler e hizo enamorado con Marie, su hija y su primer amor. La hermana de Einstein, Maja, que era quizás su confidente más cercano, debía casar más adelante a su hijo, Paul, y su amigo, Michele Besso, casaron a su otra hija, Anna.[5 ] Einstein alistaron en el instituto €ederal en octubre y se trasladaron posteriormente a Zurich, mientras que Marie se movió a Olsberg, Suiza para un poste de enseñanza. El mismo año, él renunció su ciudadanía de Württemberg. ¿En el resorte de 1896, el Mileva servio Mari? comenzado inicialmente como estudiante€ medicina en la universidad de Zurich, pero después de que un término cambiara al institut€o federal al estudio como la única mujer ese año para el mismo diploma que Einstein. La relación de Mari? con Einstein se convirtió en romance sobre los años próximos, aunque gritaría su madre que ella era demasiado vieja, no judía, y físicamente defective.[6 ] En 1900, Einstein fue concedido un diploma de enseñanza por el institut€co federal. Einstein entonces sometió su primer papel que se publicará, en las fuerzas capilares de una paja de beber, tituló "la guarida Capillarit€cheinungen del aus de Folgerungen", que tradujo es las "consecuencias de las observaciones de los fenómenos de la capilaridad" (encontrados en "el volumen 4 de Physik del der de Annalen", la página 513). En él, él intentó unificar los leyes de la física, una tentativa que él haría continuamente a través de su vida. A través de su amigo Michele Besso, ingeniero, Einstein fue presentado con los trabajos del mach de Ernst, y más adelante lo consideraría "el mejor tablero que sonaba de Europa" para las ideas físicas. Durante este tiempo, Einstein discutió sus intereses científicos con un grupo de amigos cercanos, incluyendo Besso y Mari?. Los hombres se refirieron como la "academia de Olympia". ¿Einstein y Mari? tenía una hija fuera del matrimonio, Lieserl Einstein, llevado en enero de 1902. Su sino es desconocido; algunos creen ella murió en infancia, mientras que otras creen que hacia fuera le dieron para la adopción.

===Vegetarianism===
Einstein was a dedicated vegetarian and was quite vocal about it.  He has been quoted many times in this regard.  Some of his quotes are as follows:
"Nothing will €an diet."
"Vegetarian food leaves a deep impression on our nature. If the whole
world adopts vegetarianism, it can change the destiny of humankind."
"If a man aspires towards a righteous life, his first act of abstinence is from injury to animals."
"A human€a part of the whole, called by us the 'Universe', a part l€g separate from the rest - a kind of op€ts beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security."
"Our task mu€ ourselves...by widening€of nature and its beauty."
"So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore."
"It is my view that the vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind."
"Only a €life worth living."

{{Persond€ theory]].Albert Ein€rman-born American physicist who is best known as the creator as the general and special theories of relativity and for his revolutionary hypothesis on the particle nature of light. He earned numerous honors and awards, including the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921. He was not only brilliant but also the most well known scientist of the 21st century. As a child Einstein did not like traditional ways of teaching and so he taught himself much of what he knew. At age twelve he taught€elf Euclidian geometry and withdrew from school when he was 15. A year later he enrolled secondary school and then went on to the Swiss National Polytechnic. He disliked the teaching methods there also and frequently cut class to study physics on his own or play his beloved violin. His professors did not think very highly of him and after his graduation in 1900 was not recommended for a university position. These important years in his youth allowed gave him the background knowledge that was necessary in the dev€opment of his revolutionary theories.
